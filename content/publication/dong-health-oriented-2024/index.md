abstract: Reducing air pollutants and CO2 emissions from energy utilization is crucial
  for achieving the dual objectives of clean air and carbon neutrality in China. Thus,
  an optimized health-oriented strategy is urgently needed. Herein, by coupling a
  CO2 and air pollutants emission inventory with response surface models for PM2.5-associated
  mortality, we shed light on the effectiveness of protecting human health and co-CO2
  benefit from reducing fuel-related emissions and generate a health-oriented strategy
  for the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Results reveal that oil consumption is the primary
  contributor to fuel-related PM2.5 pollution and premature deaths in the YRD. Significantly,
  curtailing fuel consumption in transportation is the most effective measure to alleviate
  the fuel-related PM2.5 health impact, which also has the greatest cobenefits for
  CO2 emission reduction on a regional scale. Reducing fuel consumption will achieve
  substantial health improvements especially in eastern YRD, with nonroad vehicle
  emission reductions being particularly impactful for health protection, while on-road
  vehicles present the greatest potential for CO2 reductions. Scenario analysis confirms
  the importance of mitigating oil consumption in the transportation sector in addressing
  PM2.5 pollution and climate change.
