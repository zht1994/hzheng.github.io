abstract: NH3 emission control has proven to be of great importance in reducing PM2.5
  concentrations in China, while how it affects nitrogen/sulfur (N/S) deposition is
  still unclear. This study expanded the response surface model method to quantify
  the responses of N/S deposition to the emission control of precursors (NOx, SO2,
  NH3, VOCs and primary PM2.5) in the Yangtze River Delta, China. NH3 control was
  found to have higher efficiency in reducing N/S deposition than NOx and SO2 alone.
  The reduced N deposition response to NH3 emission control was higher in the northern
  part of the YRD region, whereas oxidized N deposition decreased sharply in the region
  with a low N critical load. Synergetic effect was found in reducing N deposition
  when we controlled the NH3 and NOx emissions simultaneously. Compared with the sum
  effect of individual NH3 and NOx emission control, the extra benefits from the synergy
  controls accounted for 4.4% (1.23 kg N⋅ha− 1⋅yr− 1) of the total N deposition, of
  which 81% came from the oxidized N deposition. The YRD region could receive the
  largest synergetic effect with a 1:1 ratio of NOx:NH3 emission reduction. The NH3
  emission control increases the dry deposition of acid sub­ stances and worsens acid
  rain though it reduces the wet S/oxidized N deposition. These findings highlight
  the effectiveness of NH3 emission control and suggest a multi-pollutant control
  strategy for reducing N/S deposition. The response surface model method for deposition
  also provides a reference for other regions in China and other countries.
