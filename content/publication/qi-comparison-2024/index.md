abstract: 'PM2.5 is still one of the major atmospheric pollutants worldwide. Extracting
  contributions of anthropogenic emission control from the observed PM2.5 variations
  (PM2.5_anth), which are also strongly affected by meteorological changes, is critical
  for effective pollution control. Statistical and machine learning methods are usually
  used for such purpose, but the effectiveness of these methods is hard to evaluate
  due to the lack of observed anthropogenic contributions. In this study, we use the
  chemical transport model GEOS-Chem standard simulation to mimic PM2.5 variability
  in the real atmosphere, and use the model simulation with fixed meteorological fields
  as the “true value” for PM2.5_anth. We evaluate the effectiveness of three methods
  in meteorological normalization of PM2.5 on decadal (2006–2017) and synoptic (one
  month) scale: multiple linear regression (MLR), general additive model (GAM), and
  random forest (RF) algorithm. For meteorological normalization of PM2.5 on decadal
  scale, 67–72% of the MLR simulations show positive biases and 56–75% of the RF simulations
  show negative biases. The “true value” of PM2.5_anth falls within the range of meteorological
  normalization results of the three methods in most cases, but consistent positive/negative
  biases are observed in ∼30% of the cases, when meteorological changes dominate PM2.5
  variability. In addition, the biases are correlated to the contribution of meteorological
  changes. As such, multiple statistical or machine learning methods are recommended
  to quantify the uncertainties associated with method choice in cases anthropogenic
  emission changes dominate PM2.5 variability. On synoptic scale, RF performs better
  in reproducing the daily variations of the PM2.5_anth differences than MLR (GAM)
  in all (83% of) the cases, and is recommended for meteorological normalization of
  PM2.5 in short-term in eastern China.'
