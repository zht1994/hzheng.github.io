abstract: Efficient prediction of the air quality response to emission changes is
  a prerequisite for an integrated assessment system in developing effective control
  policies. Yet, representing the nonlinear response of air quality to emission controls
  with accuracy remains a major barrier in air quality-related decision making. Here,
  we demonstrate a novel method that combines deep learning approaches with chemical
  indicators of pollutant formation to quickly estimate the coefficients of air quality
  response functions using ambient concentrations of 18 chemical indicators simulated
  with a comprehensive atmospheric chemical transport model (CTM). By requiring only
  two CTM simulations for model application, the new method significantly enhances
  the computational efficiency compared to existing methods that achieve lower accuracy
  despite requiring 20+ CTM simulations (the benchmark statistical model). Our results
  demonstrate the utility of deep learning approaches for capturing the nonlinearity
  of atmospheric chemistry and physics and the prospects of the new method to support
  effective policymaking in other environment systems.
