abstract: Organic aerosol (OA) is a key component of fine particulate matter (PM2.5)
  and affects the human health and leads to climate change. With strict control measures
  for air pollutants during the last decade, the OA concentration in China declined
  slowly, while its sources remain unclear. In this study, we simulate the primary
  OA (POA) and secondary OA (SOA) concentrations from 2005 to 2019 with a state-of-the-art
  air quality model, Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ, version 5.3.2) coupled
  with a Two-Dimensional Volatility Basis Set (2D-VBS) module, and a long-term emission
  inventory of full-volatility organic compounds in China and conduct source apportionment
  and sensitivity analysis. The simulation results show that, from 2005 to 2019, the
  OA concentration in China decreased from 24.0 to 12.8 Î¼g/m3 with most of the reduction
  from POA. The OA pollution from residential biomass burning declined 75% from 2005
  to 2019, while it is still the major OA source in China. OA pollution from VCP increased
  by more than 2-fold and became the largest SOA source in China. From 2014 to 2019,
  the NOx control in China slightly offset the decrease of SOA concentration due to
  elevated oxidation capacity.
