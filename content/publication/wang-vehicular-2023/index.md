abstract: Ammonia (NH3) plays a vital role in the formation of fine particulate matter
  (PM2.5). Prior studies have primarily focused on the control of agricultural NH3
  emissions, the dominant source of anthropogenic NH3 emissions. The air quality impact
  from vehicular NH3 emissions, which could be particularly important in urban areas,
  has not been adequately evaluated. We developed high-resolution vehicular NH3 emission
  inventories for Beijing and Shanghai based on detailed link-level traffic profiles
  and conducted atmospheric simulations of ambient PM2.5 concentrations contributed
  by vehicular NH3 emissions. We found that vehicular NH3 emissions shared high proportions
  among total anthropogenic NH3 emissions in the urban areas of Beijing (86%) and
  Shanghai (45%), where vehicular NH3 was primarily emitted by gasoline vehicles.
  Local vehicular NH3 emissions could be responsible for approximately 3% of urban
  PM2.5 concentrations during wintertime, and the contributions could be much higher
  during polluted periods (∼3 μg m–3). We also showed that controlling vehicular NH3
  emissions will be effective and feasible to alleviate urban PM2.5 pollution for
  megacities in the near future.
