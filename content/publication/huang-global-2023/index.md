abstract: Traditional global emission inventories classify primary organic emissions
  into nonvolatile organic carbon and volatile organic compounds (VOCs), excluding
  intermediate-volatility and semivolatile organic compounds (IVOCs and SVOCs, respectively),
  which are important precursors of secondary organic aerosols. This study establishes
  the first global anthropogenic full-volatility organic emission inventory with chemically
  speciated or volatility-binned emission factors. The emissions of extremely low/low-volatility
  organic compounds (xLVOCs), SVOCs, IVOCs, and VOCs in 2015 were 13.2, 10.1, 23.3,
  and 120.5 Mt, respectively. The full-volatility framework fills a gap of 18.5 Mt
  I/S/xLVOCs compared with the traditional framework. Volatile chemical products (VCPs),
  domestic combustion, and onroad transportation sources were dominant contributors
  to full-volatility emissions, accounting for 30, 30, and 12%, respectively. The
  VCP and on-road transportation sectors were the main contributors to IVOCs and VOCs.
  The key emitting regions included Africa, India, Southeast Asia, China, Europe,
  and the United States, among which China, Europe, and the United States emitted
  higher proportions of IVOCs and VOCs owing to the use of cleaner fuel in domestic
  combustion and more intense emissions from VCPs and on-road transportation activities.
  The findings contribute to a better understanding of the impact of organic emissions
  on global air pollution and climate change.
