abstract: China’s advancements in addressing air pollution and reducing CO2 emissions
  offer valuable lessons for collaborative strategies to achieve diverse environmental
  objectives. Previous studies have assessed the mutual benefits of climate policies
  and air pollution control measures on one another, lacking an integrated assessment
  of the benefits of synergistic control attributed to refined measures. Here, we
  comprehensively used coupled emission inventory and response models to evaluate
  the integrated benefits and synergy degrees of various measures in reducing air
  pollutants and CO2 in China during 2013–2021. Results indicated that the implemented
  measures yielded integrated benefits value at 6.7 (2.4–12.6) trillion Chinese Yuan.
  The top five contributors, accounting for 55%, included promoting non-thermal power,
  implementing end-of-pipe control technologies in power plants and iron and steel
  industry, replacing residential scattered coal, and saving building energy. Measures
  demonstrating high synergies and integrated benefits per unit of reduction (e.g.,
  green traffic promotion) yielded low benefits mainly due to their low application,
  which are expected to gain greater implementation and prioritization in the future.
  Our findings provide insights into the effectiveness and limitations of strategies
  aimed at joint control. By ranking these measures based on their benefits and synergy,
  we offer valuable guidance for policy development in China and other nations with
  similar needs.
