abstract: Aerosol direct effects (ADEs) can modulate shortwave radiation as well as
  atmospheric dynamics and air quality. As the key absorbing component of aerosol,
  the black carbon (BC) largely determines the aerosol optical properties. Therefore,
  it is expected that BC emission controls might gain co-benefits from the simultaneous
  reduction of ADEs. To demonstrate such synergy, here we quantified the ADEs changes
  and the role of BC controls in China during 2013–2017 using a regional two-way coupled
  meteorology chemistry transport model. Simulated results suggest that the control
  action effectively reduced the wintertime PM2.5 concentration (−26.0 μg m−3) and
  associated ADEs. In January, the influence of ADEs on surface shortwave radiation,
  2-meter temperature, and planetary boundary layer height was weakened from −16.7
  W m−2, −0.20 °C, and −15.4 m in 2013 to −11.3 W m−2, −0.06 °C, and −10.7 m in 2017,
  respectively. The enhancement of SO2, NO2, and PM2.5 concentrations due to ADEs
  was reduced from +3.1%, +5.2%, and +5.4% in 2013 to +2.6%, +4.5%, and +3.3% in 2017,
  respectively, demonstrating the extra benefit of air pollution controls for improving
  air quality by reducing ADEs. Meanwhile, the BC emission reduced by 12.5% simultaneously
  along with the effective controls on SO2 and NO2 emissions during 2013–2017, mainly
  from domestic combustion (−11.7%), resulting in 30.3% (−0.9 μg m−3) reduction of
  BC concentration. Such BC controls contributed 15.6–60.2% of such changes in the
  ADEs influence on meteorological variables, and 32.6–41.1% on air pollutants. More
  specially, the effectiveness of collaborative reduction of BC further reduced surface
  shortwave radiation in China by 3.6 W m−2 in January and 1.0 W m−2 in July, leading
  to a more weakened ADEs that bring extra benefits in reducing PM2.5 concentrations
  by 1.8 μg m−3 in January and 0.3 μg m−3 in July. Apparently, BC played an important
  role in modulating the ADEs and associated influences on meteorology and air quality,
  suggesting a wise control strategy by targeting absorbing component of PM2.5 reduction
  to address both air pollution and climate change in the future.
