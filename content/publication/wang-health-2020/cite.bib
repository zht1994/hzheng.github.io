On-road vehicles have become a significant source of air pollution in Chinese cities. Air pollution in China has substantial impacts on public health and is thought to be responsible for millions of deaths each year. The government has implemented comprehensive control measures to mitigate vehicle emissions since the late 1990s. In this paper, we analyze how the historical control actions during 1998–2015 affected air quality and public health. We constructed an integrated framework combining emission scenarios, air quality modeling, and population health risk assessment. Our results demonstrate that the control measures have led to substantial improvements in public health and provide insight into strategies for further mitigation of negative effects from China’s future motorization on air quality and public health.

China started to implement comprehensive measures to mitigate traffic pollution at the end of 1990s, but the comprehensive effects, especially on ambient air quality and public health, have not yet been systematically evaluated. In this study, we analyze the effects of vehicle emission control measures on ambient air pollution and associated deaths attributable to long-term exposures of fine particulate matter (PM
2.5
) and O

based on an integrated research framework that combines scenario analysis, air quality modeling, and population health risk assessment. We find that the total impact of these control measures was substantial. Vehicular emissions during 1998–2015 would have been 2–3 times as large as they actually were, had those measures not been implemented. The national population-weighted annual average concentrations of PM
2.5
and O

in 2015 would have been higher by 11.7 μg/m

and 8.3 parts per billion, respectively, and the number of deaths attributable to 2015 air pollution would have been higher by 510 thousand (95% confidence interval: 360 thousand to 730 thousand) without these controls. Our analysis shows a concentration of mortality impacts in densely populated urban areas, motivating local policymakers to design stringent vehicle emission control policies. The results imply that vehicle emission control will require policy designs that are more multifaceted than traditional controls, primarily represented by the strict emission standards, with careful consideration of the challenges in coordinated mitigation of both PM

and O

in different regions, to sustain improvement in air quality and public health given continuing swift growth in China’s vehicle population.},
