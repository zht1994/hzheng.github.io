abstract: 'Significance On-road vehicles have become a significant source of air pollution
  in Chinese cities. Air pollution in China has substantial impacts on public health
  and is thought to be responsible for millions of deaths each year. The government
  has implemented comprehensive control measures to mitigate vehicle emissions since
  the late 1990s. In this paper, we analyze how the historical control actions during
  1998–2015 affected air quality and public health. We constructed an integrated framework
  combining emission scenarios, air quality modeling, and population health risk assessment.
  Our results demonstrate that the control measures have led to substantial improvements
  in public health and provide insight into strategies for further mitigation of negative
  effects from China’s future motorization on air quality and public health. ,   China
  started to implement comprehensive measures to mitigate traffic pollution at the
  end of 1990s, but the comprehensive effects, especially on ambient air quality and
  public health, have not yet been systematically evaluated. In this study, we analyze
  the effects of vehicle emission control measures on ambient air pollution and associated
  deaths attributable to long-term exposures of fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 )
  and O 3 based on an integrated research framework that combines scenario analysis,
  air quality modeling, and population health risk assessment. We find that the total
  impact of these control measures was substantial. Vehicular emissions during 1998–2015
  would have been 2–3 times as large as they actually were, had those measures not
  been implemented. The national population-weighted annual average concentrations
  of PM 2.5 and O 3 in 2015 would have been higher by 11.7 μg/m 3 and 8.3 parts per
  billion, respectively, and the number of deaths attributable to 2015 air pollution
  would have been higher by 510 thousand (95% confidence interval: 360 thousand to
  730 thousand) without these controls. Our analysis shows a concentration of mortality
  impacts in densely populated urban areas, motivating local policymakers to design
  stringent vehicle emission control policies. The results imply that vehicle emission
  control will require policy designs that are more multifaceted than traditional
  controls, primarily represented by the strict emission standards, with careful consideration
  of the challenges in coordinated mitigation of both PM 2.5 and O 3 in different
  regions, to sustain improvement in air quality and public health given continuing
  swift growth in China’s vehicle population.'
