abstract: The ambient air quality standard (AAQS) is a vital policy instrument for
  protecting the environment and human health. Hainan Province is at the forefront
  of China's efforts to protect its ecological environment, with an official goal
  to achieve world-leading air quality by 2035. However, neither the national AAQS
  nor the WHO guideline offers sufficient guidance for improving air quality in Hainan
  because Hainan has well met the former while the latter is excessively stringent.
  Consequently, the establishment of Hainan's local AAQS becomes imperative. Nonetheless,
  research regarding the development of local AAQS is scarce, especially in comparatively
  more polluted countries such as China. The relatively high background values and
  significant interannual fluctuations in air pollutant concentrations in Hainan present
  challenges in the development of local AAQS. Our research proposes a world-class
  local AAQS of Hainan Province by reviewing the AAQS in major countries or regions
  worldwide, analyzing the influence of different statistical forms, and carefully
  evaluating the attainability of the standard. In the proposed AAQS, the annual mean
  concentration limit for PM2.5, the annual 95th percentile of daily maximum 8-hour
  mean (MDA8) concentration limit for O3, and the peak season concentration limit
  for O3 are set at 10, 120, and 85 Î¼g/m3, respectively. Our study indicates that,
  with effective control policies, Hainan is projected to achieve compliance with
  the new standard by 2035. The implementation of the local AAQS is estimated to avoid
  1,526 (1,253-1,789) and 259 (132-501) premature deaths attributable to long-term
  exposure to PM2.5 and O3 in Hainan in 2035, respectively.
