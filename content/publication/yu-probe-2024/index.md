abstract: China currently has the highest acid deposition globally, yet research on
  its status, impacts, causes and controls is lacking. Here, we compiled data and
  calculated critical loads regarding acid deposition. The results showed that the
  abatement measures in China have achieved a sharp decline in the emissions of acidifying
  pollutants and a continuous recovery of precipitation pH, despite the drastic growth
  in the economy and energy consumption. However, the risk of ecological acidification
  and eutrophication showed no significant decrease. With similar emission reductions,
  the decline in areas at risk of acidification in China (7.0%) lags behind those
  in Europe (20%) or the USA (15%). This was because, unlike Europe and the USA, China’s
  abatement strategies primarily target air quality improvement rather than mitigating
  ecological impacts. Given that the area with the risk of eutrophication induced
  by nitrogen deposition remained at 13% of the country even under the scenario of
  achieving the dual targets of air quality and carbon dioxide mitigation in 2035,
  we explored an enhanced ammonia abatement pathway. With a further 27% reduction
  in ammonia by 2035, China could largely eliminate the impacts of acid deposition.
  This research serves as a valuable reference for China’s future acid deposition
  control and for other nations facing similar challenges.
