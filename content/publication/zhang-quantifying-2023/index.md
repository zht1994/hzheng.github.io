abstract: Quantification and control of NOx and CO2 emissions are essential across
  the world to limit adverse climate change and improve air quality. We present a
  new top-down method, an improved superposition column model to estimate day-to-day
  NOx and CO2 emissions from the large city of Wuhan, China, located in a polluted
  background. The latest released version 2.3.1 TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument)
  NO2 columns and version 10r of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2)-observed
  CO2 mixing ratio are employed. We quantified daily NOx and CO2 emissions from Wuhan
  between September 2019 and October 2020 with an uncertainty of 31 % and 43 %, compared
  to 39 % and 49 % with the earlier v1.3 TROPOMI data, respectively. Our estimated
  NOx and CO2 emissions are verified against bottom-up inventories with minor deviations
  (&lt;3 % for the 2019 mean, ranging from −20 % to 48 % on a daily basis). Based
  on the estimated CO2 emissions, we also predicted daily CO2 column mixing ratio
  enhancements, which match well with OCO-2 observations (&lt;5 % bias, within ±0.3
  ppm). We capture the day-to-day variation of NOx and CO2 emissions from Wuhan in
  2019–2020, which does not reveal a substantial “weekend reduction” but does show
  a clear “holiday reduction” in the NOx and CO2 emissions. Our method also quantifies
  the abrupt decrease and slow NOx and CO2 emissions rebound due to the Wuhan lockdown
  in early 2020. This work demonstrates the improved superposition model to be a promising
  new tool for the quantification of city NOx and CO2 emissions, allowing policymakers
  to gain real-time information on spatial–temporal emission patterns and the effectiveness
  of carbon and nitrogen regulation in urban environments.
