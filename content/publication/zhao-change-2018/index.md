abstract: The Chinese government has taken efforts to tackle the nation’s severe ambient
  fine particle (PM2.5) pollution. Our results suggest that reduced household solid-fuel
  consumption was the leading contributor to the rapid decrease in the integrated
  exposure to ambient and household PM2.5 pollution during 2005–2015, even though
  there was no explicit household control policy. In contrast, the emission reductions
  from power plants, industry, and transportation contributed much less to the decrease
  of integrated exposure. Clean household heating fuels have become part of recent
  control policies in northern China, but such policy would be strengthened if extended
  to heating and cooking countrywide since shift of the remaining household solid
  fuels to clean fuels could additionally avoid an estimated half-million premature
  deaths annually.To tackle the severe fine particle (PM2.5) pollution in China, the
  government has implemented stringent control policies mainly on power plants, industry,
  and transportation since 2005, but estimates of the effectiveness of the policy
  and the temporal trends in health impacts are subject to large uncertainties. By
  adopting an integrated approach that combines chemical transport simulation, ambient/household
  exposure evaluation, and health-impact assessment, we find that the integrated population-weighted
  exposure to PM2.5 (IPWE) decreased by 47% (95% confidence interval, 37–55%) from
  2005 [180 (146–219) μg/m3] to 2015 [96 (83–111) μg/m3]. Unexpectedly, 90% (86–93%)
  of such reduction is attributed to reduced household solid-fuel use, primarily resulting
  from rapid urbanization and improved incomes rather than specific control policies.
  The IPWE due to household fuels for both cooking and heating decreased, but the
  impact of cooking is significantly larger. The reduced household-related IPWE is
  estimated to avoid 0.40 (0.25–0.57) million premature deaths annually, accounting
  for 33% of the PM2.5-induced mortality in 2015. The IPWE would be further reduced
  by 63% (57–68%) if the remaining household solid fuels were replaced by clean fuels,
  which would avoid an additional 0.51 (0.40–0.64) million premature deaths. Such
  a transition to clean fuels, especially for heating, requires technology innovation
  and policy support to overcome the barriers of high cost of distribution systems,
  as is recently being attempted in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei area. We suggest that
  household-fuel use be more highly prioritized in national control policies, considering
  its effects on PM2.5 exposures.
