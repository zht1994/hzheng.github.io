abstract: The increasing level of O3 pollution in China significantly exacerbates
  the long-term O3 health damage, and an optimized health-oriented strategy for NOx
  and VOCs emission abatement is needed. Here, we developed an integrated evaluation
  and optimization system for the O3 control strategy by merging a response surface
  model for the O3-related mortality and an optimization module. Applying this system
  to the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), we evaluated driving factors for mortality changes
  from 2013 to 2017, quantified spatial and temporal O3-related mortality responses
  to precursor emission abatement, and optimized a health-oriented control strategy.
  Results indicate that insufficient NOx emission abatement combined with deficient
  VOCs control from 2013 to 2017 aggravated O3-related mortality, particularly during
  spring and autumn. Northern YRD should promote VOCs control due to higher VOC-limited
  characteristics, whereas fastening NOx emission abatement is more favorable in southern
  YRD. Moreover, promotion of NOx mitigation in late spring and summer and facilitating
  VOCs control in spring and autumn could further reduce O3-related mortality by nearly
  10% compared to the control strategy without seasonal differences. These findings
  highlight that a spatially and temporally differentiated NOx and VOCs emission control
  strategy could gain more O3-related health benefits, offering valuable insights
  to regions with severe ozone pollution all over the world.
