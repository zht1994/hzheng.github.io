abstract: China is challenged with the simultaneous goals of improving air quality
  and mitigating climate change. The “Beautiful China” strategy, launched by the Chinese
  government in 2020, requires that all cities in China attain 35 μg/m3 or below for
  annual mean concentration of PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter
  less than 2.5 μm) by 2035. Meanwhile, China adopts a portfolio of low-carbon policies
  to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pledged in the Paris Agreement.
  Previous studies demonstrated the cobenefits to air pollution reduction from implementing
  low-carbon energy policies. Pathways for China to achieve dual targets of both air
  quality and CO2 mitigation, however, have not been comprehensively explored. Here,
  we couple an integrated assessment model and an air quality model to evaluate air
  quality in China through 2035 under the NDC scenario and an alternative scenario
  (Co-Benefit Energy [CBE]) with enhanced low-carbon policies. Results indicate that
  some Chinese cities cannot meet the PM2.5 target under the NDC scenario by 2035,
  even with the strictest end-of-pipe controls. Achieving the air quality target would
  require further reduction in emissions of multiple air pollutants by 6 to 32%, driving
  additional 22% reduction in CO2 emissions relative to the NDC scenario. Results
  show that the incremental health benefit from improved air quality of CBE exceeds
  8 times the additional costs of CO2 mitigation, attributed particularly to the cost-effective
  reduction in household PM2.5 exposure. The additional low-carbon energy polices
  required for China’s air quality targets would lay an important foundation for its
  deep decarbonization aligned with the 2 °C global temperature target.
