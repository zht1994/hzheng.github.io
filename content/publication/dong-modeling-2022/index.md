abstract: Biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA) produced from naturally emitted
  biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) is closely affected by anthropogenic
  emissions. Reactive nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfate (SO4), and primary organic aerosol
  (POA) modulate transformations of BVOCs by altering the oxidation pathways and gas–particle
  partitioning processes. China has experienced rapid changes in anthropogenic emissions
  recently, but the response of BSOA remains unclear. We conducted GEOS-Chem simulations
  to examine this response and found that isoprene-derived SOA increased (3.1%/yr)
  similarly as SO4 (3.6%/yr) over 2000–2006 but declined faster (−8.0%/yr) than SO4
  (−4.3%/yr) over 2007–2015. Sensitivity simulations suggested that SO4 significantly
  promoted heterogeneous reactive uptake of isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX) formed SOA
  (SOAIE), and a high level of NOx suppressed the production of IEPOX and subsequently
  reduced SOAIE. The model roughly reproduced observed declines of secondary organic
  carbon (SOC) and SO4 at a rural site in South China over 2007–2011, although the
  mass concentrations were substantially underestimated. We find that BSOA would contribute
  slightly more to PM2.5 (2.8%) in 2050 under the RCP4.5 scenario than the present
  day (2.1%). This model-based work provides insights into historical and future changes
  of BSOA and implies the need to consider the controllable part for air quality management.
