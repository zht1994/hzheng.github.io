abstract: As the world's most populous country, China has witnessed rapid urbanization
  in recent decades, with population migration from rural to urban (RU) regions as
  the major driving force. Due to the large gap between rural and urban consumption
  and investment level, large-scale RU migration impacts air pollutant emissions and
  creates extra uncertainties for air quality improvement. Here, we integrated population
  migration assessment, an environmentally extended input–output model and structural
  decomposition analysis to evaluate the NOx, SO2 and primary PM2.5 emissions induced
  by RU migration during China's urbanization from 2005 to 2015. The results show
  that RU migration increased air pollutant emissions, while the increases in NOx
  and SO2 emissions peaked in approximately 2010 at 2.4 Mt and 2.2 Mt, accounting
  for 9.2% and 8.7% of the national emissions, respectively. The primary PM2.5 emissions
  induced by RU migration also peaked in approximately 2012 at 0.3 Mt, accounting
  for 2.8% of the national emissions. The indirect emissions embodied in consumption
  and investment increased, while household direct emissions decreased. The widening
  gap between urban and rural investment and consumption exerted a major increasing
  effect on migration-induced emissions; in contrast, the falling emission intensity
  contributed the most to the decreasing effect benefitting from end-of-pipe control
  technology applications as well as improving energy efficiency. The peak of air
  pollutant emissions induced by RU migration indicates that although urbanization
  currently creates extra environmental pressure in China, it is possible to reconcile
  urbanization and air quality improvement in the future with updating urbanization
  and air pollution control policies.
