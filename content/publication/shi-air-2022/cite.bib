 abstract = {As the world's most populous country, China has witnessed rapid urbanization in recent decades, with population migration from rural to urban (RU) regions as the major driving force. Due to the large gap between rural and urban consumption and investment level, large-scale RU migration impacts air pollutant emissions and creates extra uncertainties for air quality improvement. Here, we integrated population migration assessment, an environmentally extended input–output model and structural decomposition analysis to evaluate the NOx, SO2 and primary PM2.5 emissions induced by RU migration during China's urbanization from 2005 to 2015. The results show that RU migration increased air pollutant emissions, while the increases in NOx and SO2 emissions peaked in approximately 2010 at 2.4 Mt and 2.2 Mt, accounting for 9.2% and 8.7% of the national emissions, respectively. The primary PM2.5 emissions induced by RU migration also peaked in approximately 2012 at 0.3 Mt, accounting for 2.8% of the national emissions. The indirect emissions embodied in consumption and investment increased, while household direct emissions decreased. The widening gap between urban and rural investment and consumption exerted a major increasing effect on migration-induced emissions; in contrast, the falling emission intensity contributed the most to the decreasing effect benefitting from end-of-pipe control technology applications as well as improving energy efficiency. The peak of air pollutant emissions induced by RU migration indicates that although urbanization currently creates extra environmental pressure in China, it is possible to reconcile urbanization and air quality improvement in the future with updating urbanization and air pollution control policies.},
