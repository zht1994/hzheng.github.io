abstract: 'The COVID-19 outbreak provides a “controlled experiment” to investigate
  the response of aerosol pollution to the reduction of anthropogenic activities.
  Here we explore the chemical characteristics, variations, and emission sources of
  organic aerosol (OA) based on the observation of air pollutants and combination
  of aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis
  in Beijing in early 2020. By eliminating the impacts of atmospheric boundary layer
  and the Spring Festival, we found that the lockdown effectively reduced cooking-related
  OA (COA) but influenced fossil fuel combustion OA (FFOA) very little. In contrast,
  both secondary OA (SOA) and O3 formation was enhanced significantly after lockdown:
  less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA, 37% in OA) was probably an aged product from
  fossil fuel and biomass burning emission with aqueous chemistry being an important
  formation pathway, while more-oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA, 41% in OA) was affected
  by regional transport of air pollutants and related with both aqueous and photochemical
  processes. Combining FFOA and LO-OOA, more than 50% of OA pollution was attributed
  to combustion activities during the whole observation period. Our findings highlight
  that fossil fuel/biomass combustion are still the largest sources of OA pollution,
  and only controlling traffic and cooking emissions cannot efficiently eliminate
  the heavy air pollution in winter Beijing.'
