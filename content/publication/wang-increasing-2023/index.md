abstract: 'A synergistic pathway is regarded as a critical measure for tackling the
  intertwined challenges of climate change and air pollution in China. However, there
  is as yet no indicator that can comprehensively reflect such synergistic effects;
  hence, existing studies lack a consistent framework for comparison. Here, we introduce
  a new synergistic indicator defined as the pollutant generation per gross domestic
  product (GDP) and adopt an integrated analysis framework by linking the logarithmic
  mean Divisia index (LMDI) method, response surface model (RSM), and global exposure
  mortality model (GEMM) to evaluate the synergistic effects of carbon mitigation
  on both air pollutant reduction and public health in China. The results show that
  synergistic effects played an increasingly important role in the emissions mitigation
  of SO2, NOx, and primary particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter no greater
  than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), and the synergistic mitigation of pollutants respectively increase
  from 3.1, 1.4, and 0.3 Mt during the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2006–2010) to 5.6,
  3.7, and 1.9 Mt during the 12th FYP (2011–2015). Against the non-control scenario,
  synergistic effects alone contributed to a 15% reduction in annual mean PM2.5 concentration,
  resulting in the prevention of 0.29 million (95% confidential interval: 0.28–0.30)
  PM2.5-attributable excess deaths in 2015. Synergistic benefits to air quality improvement
  and public health were remarkable in the developed and population-dense eastern
  provinces and municipalities. With the processes of urbanization and carbon neutrality
  in the future, synergistic effects are expected to continue to increase. Realizing
  climate targets in advance in developed regions would concurrently bring strong
  synergistic effects to air quality and public health.'
