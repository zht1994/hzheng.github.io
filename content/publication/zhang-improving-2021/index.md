abstract: 'We compare Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model predictions with
  measured nitrous acid (HONO) concentrations in Beijing, China, for December 2015.
  The model with the existing HONO chemistry in CMAQ severely underestimates the observed
  HONO concentrations with a normalized mean bias of −97 %. We revise the HONO chemistry
  in the model by implementing six additional heterogeneous reactions in the model:
  the reaction of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on ground surfaces, the reaction of NO2 on
  aerosol surfaces, the reaction of NO2 on soot surfaces, the photolysis of aerosol
  nitrate, the nitric acid displacement reaction, and the hydrochloric acid displacement
  reaction. The model with the revised chemistry substantially increases HONO predictions
  and improves the comparison with observed data with a normalized mean bias of −5
  %. The photolysis of HONO enhances daytime hydroxyl radical by almost a factor of
  2. The enhanced hydroxyl radical concentrations compare favorably with observed
  data and produce additional sulfate via the reaction with sulfur dioxide, aerosol
  nitrate via the reaction with nitrogen dioxide, and secondary organic aerosols via
  the reactions with volatile organic compounds. The additional sulfate stemming from
  revised HONO chemistry improves the comparison with observed concentration; however,
  it does not close the gap between model prediction and the observation during polluted
  days.'
