abstract: From 2013 to 2019, a series of air pollution control actions significantly
  reduced PM2.5 pollution in China. Control actions included changes in activity levels,
  structural adjustment (SA) policy, energy and material saving (EMS) policy, and
  end-of-pipe (EOP) control in several sources, which have not been systematically
  studied in previous studies. Here, we integrate an emission inventory, a chemical
  transport model, a health impact assessment model, and a scenario analysis to quantify
  the contribution of each control action across a range of major emission sources
  to the changes in PM2.5 concentrations and associated mortality in China from 2013
  to 2019. Assuming equal toxicity of PM2.5 from all the sources, we estimate that
  PM2.5-related mortality decreased from 2.52 (95 % confidence interval, 2.13–2.88)
  to 1.94 (1.62–2.24) million deaths. Anthropogenic emission reductions and declining
  baseline incidence rates significantly contributed to health benefits, but population
  aging partially offset their impact. Among the major sources, controls on power
  plants and industrial boilers were responsible for the highest reduction in PM2.5-related
  mortality (~80 %), followed by industrial processes (~40 %), residential combustion
  (~40 %), and transportation (~30 %). However, considering the potentially higher
  relative risks of power plant PM2.5, the adverse effects avoided by their control
  could be ~2.4 times the current estimation. Our power plant sensitivity analyses
  indicate that future estimates of source-specific PM2.5 health effects should incorporate
  variations in individual source PM2.5 effect coefficients when available. As for
  the control actions, while activity levels increased for most sources, SA policy
  significantly reduced the emissions in residential combustion and industrial boilers,
  and EOP control dominated the contribution in health benefits in most sources except
  residential combustion. Considering the emission reduction potential by source and
  control actions in 2019, our results suggest that promoting clean energy in residential
  combustion and enforcing more stringent EOP control in the iron and steel industry
  should be prioritized in the future.
