abstract: PM2.5 retrieval from satellite-observed aerosol optical depth (AOD) is still
  challenging due to the strong impact of meteorology. We investigate influences of
  meteorology changes on the inter-annual variations of AOD and surface PM2.5 in China
  between 2006 and 2017 using a nested 3D chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem, by
  fixing emissions at the 2006 level. We then identify major meteorological elements
  controlling the inter-annual variations of AOD and surface PM2.5 using multiple
  linear regression. We find larger influences of meteorology changes on trends of
  AOD than that of surface PM2.5. On the seasonal scale, meteorology changes are beneficial
  to AOD and surface PM2.5 reduction in spring (1&ndash;50%) but show an adverse effect
  on aerosol reduction in summer. In addition, major meteorological elements influencing
  variations of AOD and PM2.5 are similar between spring and fall. In winter, meteorology
  changes are favorable to AOD reduction (&minus;0.007 yr&minus;1, &minus;1.2% yr&minus;1;
  p &lt; 0.05) but enhanced surface PM2.5 between 2006 and 2017. The difference in
  winter is mainly attributed to the stable boundary layer that isolates surface PM2.5
  from aloft. The significant decrease in AOD over the years is related to the increase
  in meridional wind speed at 850 hPa in NCP (p &lt; 0.05). The increase of surface
  PM2.5 in NCP in winter is possibly related to the increased temperature inversion
  and more stable stratification in the boundary layer. This suggests that previous
  estimates of wintertime surface PM2.5 using satellite measurements of AOD corrected
  by meteorological elements should be used with caution. Our findings provide potential
  meteorological elements that might improve the retrieval of surface PM2.5 from satellite-observed
  AOD on the seasonal scale.
