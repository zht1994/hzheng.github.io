abstract: Ammonia (NH3) abatement remains controversial in China owing to its effectiveness
  in reducing PM2.5 pollution and nitrogen deposition but with the potential risk
  of promoting acid rain formation, necessitating scientific guidance. Here, we propose
  a novel method for designing an NH3 control strategy to mitigate both air pollution
  and nitrogen deposition without significantly exacerbating acid rain. This method
  involves extending the response surface model (RSM) to deposition using a delicately
  developed polynomial response function of deposition (i.e., dep-RSM). The Yangtze
  River Delta (YRD) dep-RSM application reveals that 16 out of 41 cities have NH3
  control potentials from 15 % to 71 %. Excellent NH3 control potentials have been
  noted between April and June (78 %–92 %). From 2013 to 2017, the effective SO2 and
  NOx control significantly reduced wet sulfur and oxidized nitrogen deposition, providing
  considerable NH3 abatement potentials (15 %–24 %) to further reduce PM2.5 and nitrogen
  deposition by up to 2 % and 9 %, respectively, without acid rain exacerbation (the
  wet neutralization factor was maintained). Additionally, 57 % and 73 % NH3 emission
  reduction potentials were obtained under acid rain constraints with 75 % and 86
  % reductions in the other precursors to reduce the average PM2.5 concentration below
  25 and 15 μg/m3, and an additional 8408 and 14,459 premature deaths could only be
  avoided at an extra cost of 8.7 and 19.7 billion CNY, respectively. Meanwhile, the
  N deposition considerably reduced by 10 and 13 kgN/ha·yr. However, the YRD region
  could still simultaneously obtain substantial amounts of PM2.5 and N deposition
  mitigation using the strategy proposed herein. The expanded optimization system
  can be directly adopted by policymakers to implement coordinated control in regions
  or countries facing the same NH3 control conundrum.
