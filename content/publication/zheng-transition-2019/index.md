abstract: The serious ﬁne particle (PM2.5) pollution in China causes millions of premature
  deaths. Driven by swift economic growth and stringent control policies, air pollutant
  emissions in China have changed signiﬁcantly in the last decade, but the change
  in the source contribution of PM2.5-related health impacts remains unclear. In this
  study, we develop a multi-pollutant emission inventory in China for 2005–2015, and
  combine chemical transport modeling, ambient/household exposure evaluation and health
  impact assessment to quantify the contribution of eight emission sectors to PM2.5
  exposure and associated health risk. From 2005 to 2015, the mortality due to PM2.5
  from ambient air pollution (AAP) decreases from 1.04 (95% conﬁdence interval, 0.84–1.25)
  million to 0.87 (0.70–1.04) million. The agricultural sector contributes 25% and
  32% to ambient PM2.5-attributed mortality in 2005 and 2015, respectively, representing
  the largest contributor during this period. The contribution of power plants drops
  monotonously from 13% to 6%. The percentage contribution of industrial process drops
  signiﬁcantly while the contribution of industrial combustion stays the same level.
  The overall contribution of industry is still as large as 26% in 2015 in spite of
  strict control measures. For transportation, despite strict emission standards,
  its contribution increases remarkably due to the rapid growth of vehicle population.
  When both ambient and household PM2.5 exposures are taken into account, the mortality
  due to integrated populationweighted exposure to PM2.5 (IPWE) drops from 1.78 (1.46–2.09)
  million in 2005 to 1.28 (1.05–1.52) million in 2015. Most of the IPWE reduction
  comes from domestic combustion as a result of urbanization and improved income,
  whereas this sector remains the largest contributor (58%) to IPWE-related health
  risk in 2015. Our results suggest that the government should dynamically adjust
  the air pollution control strategy according to the change in source contributions.
  Domestic combustion and agriculture should be prioritized considering their predominant
  contributions to mortality and the lack of eﬀective control policies. More stringent
  control measures for industry and transportation are necessary since the existing
  policies have not adequately reduced their health impacts. Electricity production
  is no longer the top priority of air pollution control policies given its lower
  health impact compared with that of other sources.
