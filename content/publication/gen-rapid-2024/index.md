abstract: Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) hydrolysis in deliquesced aerosol particles forms
  nitrous acid and nitrate and thus impacts air quality, climate, and the nitrogen
  cycle. Traditionally, it is considered to proceed far too slowly in the atmosphere.
  However, the significance of this process is highly uncertain because kinetic studies
  have only been made in dilute aqueous solutions but not under high ionic strength
  conditions of the aerosol particles. Here, we use laboratory experiments, air quality
  models, and field measurements to examine the effect of the ionic strength on the
  reaction kinetics of NO2 hydrolysis. We find that high ionic strengths (I) enhance
  the reaction rate constants (kI) by more than an order of magnitude compared to
  that at infinite dilution (kI=0), yielding log10(kI/kI=0) = 0.04I or rate enhancement
  factor = 100.04I. A state-of-the-art air quality model shows that the enhanced NO2
  hydrolysis reduces the negative bias in the simulated concentrations of nitrous
  acid by 28% on average when compared to field observations over the North China
  Plain. Rapid NO2 hydrolysis also enhances the levels of nitrous acid in other polluted
  regions such as North India and further promotes atmospheric oxidation capacity.
  This study highlights the need to evaluate various reaction kinetics of atmospheric
  aerosols with high ionic strengths.
