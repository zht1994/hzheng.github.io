abstract: This study jointly conducted a field investigation and thermodynamic model
  simulation in three nonferrous metal smelters (NFMS) to identify sulfur oxides (SOX)
  formation, transformation, and emissions in the flue gas. Most of SOX was released
  as sulfur dioxides (SO2) at the outlet of the furnace with the molar proportion
  of sulfur trioxides (SO3) of 1.0â€“4.1%. The formation of SO3 in smelters depended
  on temperature, material composition, and flue gas components. These factors were
  relatively certain once the production was designed. During the use of air pollution
  control devices (APCDs), SO3 removal alternated with its formation in the APCDs
  of the smelting/roasting step. Deep clean measures could not ensure standard emissions
  of SO3 in all smelters. Under the strict production and emission requirements, we
  recommended the combined effort of production design, parameter optimization, and
  deep clean measures to control SO3 pollution. In addition, recognizing the underestimation
  of the national inventory (10% at the most) due to the lack of emissions from NFMS,
  we suggested the attention on SOX emissions from sectors using high-sulfur raw materials
  in the pyroprocess. Besides, the higher potential of SO3 on secondary particle formation
  highlighted the distinction of SO3 and SO2 emissions in inventories for better evaluation
  of their environmental impact.
