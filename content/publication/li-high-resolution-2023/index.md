abstract: Quantifying the full-volatility organic emissions from cooking sources is
  important for understanding the causes of organic aerosol pollution. However, existing
  national cooking emission inventories in China fail to cover full-volatility organics
  and have large biases in estimating emissions and their spatial distribution. Here,
  we develop the first emission inventory of full-volatility organics from cooking
  in China, which covers emissions from individual commercial restaurants as well
  as residential kitchens and canteens. In our emission estimates, we use cuisine-specific
  full-volatility emission factors and provincial policy-driven purification facility
  installation proportions, which allows us to consider the significant impact of
  diverse dietary preferences and policy changes on China's cooking emissions. The
  2021 emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), intermediate-volatility organic
  compounds (IVOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and organic compounds
  with even lower volatility (xLVOCs) from cooking in China are 561 (317–891, 95 %
  confidence interval) kt yr−1, 241 (135–374) kt yr−1, 176 (95.8–290) kt yr−1, and
  13.1 (7.36–21.0) kt yr−1, respectively. The IVOC and SVOC emissions from cooking
  account for 9 %–21 % and 31 %–62 % of the total emissions from all sources in the
  five most densely populated cities in China. Among all cooking types, commercial
  cooking dominates the emissions, contributing 54.5 %, 66.2 %, 68.5 %, and 46.7 %
  to the VOC, IVOC, SVOC, and xLVOC emissions, respectively. Sichuan–Hunan cuisine
  contributes the most to total cooking emissions among all commercial cuisines. Residential
  cooking emissions are also important, accounting for 22.2 %–47.1 % of the cooking
  organic emissions across the four volatility ranges, whereas canteens make minor
  contributions to each volatility range (&lt;10 %). In terms of spatial distribution,
  emission hotspots mainly occur in densely populated areas and regions with oily
  and spicy dietary preferences. From 2015 to 2021, national organic emissions from
  cooking increased by 25.2 % because of the rapid growth of the catering industry,
  despite being partly offset by the increased installation of purification facilities.
  Future control measures need to further promote the purification facilities in commercial
  restaurants and improve their removal efficiency as well as reduce emissions from
  residential cooking. Our dataset and generalizable methodology serve as valuable
  resources for evaluating the air quality, climate, and health impacts of cooking
  sources, and help to formulate effective emission control policies. Our national,
  multi-year, high-spatial-resolution dataset can be accessed from https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.23537673
  (Li et al., 2023).
