 abstract = {Quantifying the full-volatility organic emissions from cooking sources is important for understanding the causes of organic aerosol pollution. However, existing national cooking emission inventories in China fail to cover full-volatility organics and have large biases in estimating emissions and their spatial distribution. Here, we develop the first emission inventory of full-volatility organics from cooking in China, which covers emissions from individual commercial restaurants as well as residential kitchens and canteens. In our emission estimates, we use cuisine-specific full-volatility emission factors and provincial policy-driven purification facility installation proportions, which allows us to consider the significant impact of diverse dietary preferences and policy changes on China's cooking emissions. The 2021 emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and organic compounds with even lower volatility (xLVOCs) from cooking in China are 561 (317–891, 95 % confidence interval) kt yr−1, 241 (135–374) kt yr−1, 176 (95.8–290) kt yr−1, and 13.1 (7.36–21.0) kt yr−1, respectively. The IVOC and SVOC emissions from cooking account for 9 %–21 % and 31 %–62 % of the total emissions from all sources in the five most densely populated cities in China. Among all cooking types, commercial cooking dominates the emissions, contributing 54.5 %, 66.2 %, 68.5 %, and 46.7 % to the VOC, IVOC, SVOC, and xLVOC emissions, respectively. Sichuan–Hunan cuisine contributes the most to total cooking emissions among all commercial cuisines. Residential cooking emissions are also important, accounting for 22.2 %–47.1 % of the cooking organic emissions across the four volatility ranges, whereas canteens make minor contributions to each volatility range (&lt;10 %). In terms of spatial distribution, emission hotspots mainly occur in densely populated areas and regions with oily and spicy dietary preferences. From 2015 to 2021, national organic emissions from cooking increased by 25.2 % because of the rapid growth of the catering industry, despite being partly offset by the increased installation of purification facilities. Future control measures need to further promote the purification facilities in commercial restaurants and improve their removal efficiency as well as reduce emissions from residential cooking. Our dataset and generalizable methodology serve as valuable resources for evaluating the air quality, climate, and health impacts of cooking sources, and help to formulate effective emission control policies.
