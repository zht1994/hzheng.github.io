abstract: Heavy metals are concerned for its adverse effect on human health and long
  term burden on biogeochemical cycling in the ecosystem. In this study, a provincial-level
  emission inventory of 13 kinds of heavy metals including V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu,
  Zn, As, Cd, Sn, Sb, Ba and Pb from 10 anthropogenic sources was developed for China,
  based on the 2015 national emission inventory of primary particulate matters and
  source category-specific speciation profiles collected from 50 previous studies
  measured in China. Uncertainties associated with the speciation profiles were also
  evaluated. Our results suggested that total emissions of the 13 types of heavy metals
  in China are estimated at about 58000 ton for the year 2015. The iron production
  is the dominant source of heavy metal, contributing 42% of total emissions of heavy
  metals. The emissions of heavy metals vary significantly at regional scale, with
  largest amount of emissions concentrated in northern and eastern China. Particular,
  high emissions of Cr, Co, Ni, As and Sb (contributing 8%–18% of the national emissions)
  are found in Shandong where has large capacity of industrial production. Uncertainty
  analysis suggested that the implementation of province-specific source profiles
  in this study significantly reduced the emission uncertainties from (−89%, 289%)
  to (−99%, 91%), particularly for coal combustion. However, source profiles for industry
  sectors such as non-metallic mineral manufacturing are quite limited, resulting
  in a relative high uncertainty. The high-resolution emission inventories of heavy
  metals are essential not only for their distribution, deposition and transport studies,
  but for the design of policies to redress critical atmospheric environmental hazards
  at local and regional scales. Detailed investigation on source-specific profile
  in China are still needed to achieve more accurate estimations of heavy metals in
  the future.
