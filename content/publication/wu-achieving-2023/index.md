abstract: Protecting human health from fine particulate matter (PM) pollution is the
  ambitious goal of clean air actions, but current control strategies  largely ignore
  the role of source-specific PM toxicity. Here, we proposed health-oriented control
  strategies by integrating the unequal toxic potencies of the most polluting industrial
  PMs. Iron and steel industry (ISI)-emitted PM2.5 exhibit about one order of magnitude
  higher toxic potency than those of cement and power industries. Compared with the
  current mass-based control strategy (prioritizing implementation of ultralow emission
  standards in the power sector), the proposed health-oriented control strategy (priority
  control of the ISI sector) could generate 5.4 times higher reduction in population-weighted
  toxic potency-adjusted PM2.5 exposure among polluting industries in China. Furthermore,
  the marginal abatement cost per unit of toxic potency-adjusted mass of ISI-emitted
  PM2.5 is only a quarter of that of the other two sectors under ultralow emission
  scenarios. We highlight that a health-oriented air pollution control strategy is
  urgently required to achieve cost-effective reductions in particulate exposure risks.
