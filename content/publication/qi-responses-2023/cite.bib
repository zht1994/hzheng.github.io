 abstract = {We investigate responses of sulfate (SO42−) and nitrate (NO3−) to anthropogenic emission changes in 2006–2017 by fixing meteorology at the 2009 level using nested 3D chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. We find that sulfate concentration decreases following SO2 emissions, but with a relatively smaller reduction rate (by 16 % in North China Plain (NCP) and 28 % in Yangtze River Delta (YRD)) due to larger sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) at lower SO2 level. SOR follows a power law with SO2 emissions in general except in winter in NCP, when and where both SO2 emission reduction and atmospheric oxidation capacity are critical to the inter-annual variations of SOR. Nitrate concentration ([pNO3−]) decreases along with NOx emission reduction in summer, but increases slightly in winter in 2011–2017. Equilibrium with gas phase HNO3, NO3− in particle phase (pNO3−) is determined by total HNO3 (TN = [pNO3−] + [gHNO3]) oxidized from NO2 and gas-particle partitioning (ε(NO3−) = [pNO3−]/TN). TN is decreasing faster in summer (~33 %) than in winter (~25 %) in 2011–2017. In contrast, ε(NO3−) changes marginally in summer (within 5 %) but increases by 36 % in NCP and by 51 % in YRD in winter in 2006–2017. The increasing of ε(NO3−) in winter is attributed to the strong reduction of [pSO42−], which increases the relative abundance of NH3 and thus favors partitioning of NO3− to the particle phase. The effect of increasing ε(NO3−) overcomes that of decreasing TN in winter. We suggest reduce SO2 emissions to further reduce [pSO42−] in eastern China. In addition, we recommend reduce NOx emissions in summer, and reduce atmospheric oxidation capacity and relative abundance of NH3 in winter to reduce [pNO3−].},
