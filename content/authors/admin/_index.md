#       I studied the foundational concept of neural networks and deep learning. By the end, I was familiar with the significant technological trends driving the rise of deep learning; build, train, and apply fully connected deep neural networks; implement efficient (vectorized) neural networks; identify key parameters in a neural network’s architecture; and apply deep learning to your own applications.

#     summary: |
#       Object-oriented programming (OOP) lets you specify relationships between functions and the objects that they can act on, helping you manage complexity in your code. This is an intermediate level course, providing an introduction to OOP, using the S3 and R6 systems. S3 is a great day-to-day R programming tool that simplifies some of the functions that you write. R6 is especially useful for industry-specific analyses, working with web APIs, and building GUIs.

## Welcome

Welcome to my research group! I'm Haotian Zheng, an environmental scientist with a passion for understanding the sources and transformations of air pollution, its impacts on human health and society, and the development of control policies for air pollution and climate change.
I am currently looking for motivated master's and PhD students, as well as postdoctoral researchers, to join our team. If you’re interested in these areas, don’t hesitate to reach out—I’d love to hear from you! Preference will be given to those with a background in environmental or atmospheric sciences, and programming experience is a plus. I also warmly welcome opportunities for academic collaboration.
