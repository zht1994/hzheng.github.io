	volume = {115},
	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1812955115},
	abstract = {The Chinese government has taken efforts to tackle the nation’s severe ambient fine particle (PM2.5) pollution. Our results suggest that reduced household solid-fuel consumption was the leading contributor to the rapid decrease in the integrated exposure to ambient and household PM2.5 pollution during 2005–2015, even though there was no explicit household control policy. In contrast, the emission reductions from power plants, industry, and transportation contributed much less to the decrease of integrated exposure. Clean household heating fuels have become part of recent control policies in northern China, but such policy would be strengthened if extended to heating and cooking countrywide since shift of the remaining household solid fuels to clean fuels could additionally avoid an estimated half-million premature deaths annually.To tackle the severe fine particle (PM2.5) pollution in China, the government has implemented stringent control policies mainly on power plants, industry, and transportation since 2005, but estimates of the effectiveness of the policy and the temporal trends in health impacts are subject to large uncertainties. By adopting an integrated approach that combines chemical transport simulation, ambient/household exposure evaluation, and health-impact assessment, we find that the integrated population-weighted exposure to PM2.5 (IPWE) decreased by 47\% (95\% confidence interval, 37–55\%) from 2005 [180 (146–219) μg/m3] to 2015 [96 (83–111) μg/m3]. Unexpectedly, 90\% (86–93\%) of such reduction is attributed to reduced household solid-fuel use, primarily resulting from rapid urbanization and improved incomes rather than specific control policies. The IPWE due to household fuels for both cooking and heating decreased, but the impact of cooking is significantly larger. The reduced household-related IPWE is estimated to avoid 0.40 (0.25–0.57) million premature deaths annually, accounting for 33\% of the PM2.5-induced mortality in 2015. The IPWE would be further reduced by 63\% (57–68\%) if the remaining household solid fuels were replaced by clean fuels, which would avoid an additional 0.51 (0.40–0.64) million premature deaths. Such a transition to clean fuels, especially for heating, requires technology innovation and policy support to overcome the barriers of high cost of distribution systems, as is recently being attempted in the Beijing–Tianjin–Hebei area. We suggest that household-fuel use be more highly prioritized in national control policies, considering its effects on PM2.5 exposures.},

	abstract = {PM2.5 retrieval from satellite-observed aerosol optical depth (AOD) is still challenging due to the strong impact of meteorology. We investigate influences of meteorology changes on the inter-annual variations of AOD and surface PM2.5 in China between 2006 and 2017 using a nested 3D chemical transport model, GEOS-Chem, by fixing emissions at the 2006 level. We then identify major meteorological elements controlling the inter-annual variations of AOD and surface PM2.5 using multiple linear regression. We find larger influences of meteorology changes on trends of AOD than that of surface PM2.5. On the seasonal scale, meteorology changes are beneficial to AOD and surface PM2.5 reduction in spring (1\&ndash;50\%) but show an adverse effect on aerosol reduction in summer. In addition, major meteorological elements influencing variations of AOD and PM2.5 are similar between spring and fall. In winter, meteorology changes are favorable to AOD reduction (\&minus;0.007 yr\&minus;1, \&minus;1.2\% yr\&minus;1; p \&lt; 0.05) but enhanced surface PM2.5 between 2006 and 2017. The difference in winter is mainly attributed to the stable boundary layer that isolates surface PM2.5 from aloft. The significant decrease in AOD over the years is related to the increase in meridional wind speed at 850 hPa in NCP (p \&lt; 0.05). The increase of surface PM2.5 in NCP in winter is possibly related to the increased temperature inversion and more stable stratification in the boundary layer. This suggests that previous estimates of wintertime surface PM2.5 using satellite measurements of AOD corrected by meteorological elements should be used with caution. Our findings provide potential meteorological elements that might improve the retrieval of surface PM2.5 from satellite-observed AOD on the seasonal scale.},

This study tried to shed some light on sources of gaseous NH3 through integrating the parallel measurements of δ15N values in NH4+ and ambient NH3, NH3 source signature measurement, IsoSource model, and chemistry and transport model (CTM). As a result, predicted initial δ15N (NH3) values ranging from −42.0‰ to −4.9‰ were derived from daily δ15N(NH4+) values of fine particulate NH4+, and δ15N(NH3) values ranging from −26.8‰ to −17.2‰ were obtained from weekday/weekend δ15N(NH3) values, respectively. During summer, non-agricultural sources (e.g. fossil fuel sources, urban waste) contributed 63\% to ambient NH3 in urban Beijing, derived from δ15N(NH3) values whereas 64\% to ambient NH3, derived from δ15N(NH4+) values. These results suggested that non-agricultural sources were main contributors to gaseous NH3 even during summer and agricultural sources were not likely the main source of gaseous NH3 in urban Beijing. To further reduce the uncertainty of isotope-based source apportionment results, more laboratory and field studies are necessary to refine the δ15N(NH3) source profile of NH3 using validated collection technique as overlapping exist between δ15N(NH3) values in agricultural sources such as livestock breeding waste (−42.5‰ to −29.1‰) and fertilizer application (−51.5‰ to −35.0‰).},

	abstract = {China is facing the challenge of synergistic reduction of air pollutants and CO2 emissions. However, the studies on its historical progress and future priorities are insufficient. This study compiled China's emission inventory of air pollutants and CO2 from 2005 to 2021 (ABaCAS-EI v2.0 dataset) based on a unified emission-source framework by considering the influences of activity level, technology evolution, and emission control policies. The characteristics of air pollutants and CO2 emissions were comprehensively analyzed from multiple dimensions such as time, space, sector, and synergies between air pollutants and CO2 emissions. Mitigation policies have decoupled the emissions of air pollutants and CO2 with economic development in China since 2013. In the context of growing activity levels, energy structure adjustment and energy and material saving reduced the average annual increase rate of CO2 emissions by 7 \% after 2011. Based on this, end-of-pipe control contributed 51 \%–98 \% of air pollutant emission reductions after 2013. Industrial boilers and residential fossil fuel combustion sectors in seven provinces (Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Jilin, Henan, Sichuan, and Qinghai) achieved emission reductions in both air pollutants and CO2 during 2013–2021. The declining trends in both the sectoral and regional emission ratios of air pollutants to CO2 indicated that the potential for synergistic emission reduction in China declined from 2013 to 2021. The emission ratios in 2021 showed that residential fossil fuel combustion, iron and steel industry, and transportation exhibited relatively higher co-benefits of SO2, PM2.5, NOx, and VOC emission reductions when CO2 emissions were reduced. Most cities with a higher potential to synergistically reduce NOx, VOC, and CO2 emissions were within the Yangtze River Economic Belt, while those with a higher potential to co-control SO2 and CO2, and PM2.5 and CO2 were in southern and northeast China, respectively. Further deconstruction of the sectoral emissions in 2021 suggested future reduction measures: for example, controlling coal consumption in the energy field; promoting innovative technologies with low air pollutant emission intensities and coal-saving measures in the iron and steel industry; combining coal and carbonate replacement technologies with separated particle control measures in the cement industry; and controlling light-duty passenger vehicles, heavy-duty trucks, agricultural machinery, and inland water transport in the transportation sector. Our dataset and findings provide insights into the co-control of air pollutants and CO2 emissions in the future in China and other countries with the same demand.

	abstract = {Emissions of organic compounds have strong influences on the environment. Most previous emission inventories only cover the emissions of particulate organic carbon and nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOC) but neglect the semivolatile and intermediate volatile organic compounds (S/ IVOC), which considerably contribute to the organic aerosol (OA) burden. Herein, we developed a full-volatility emission inventory of organic compounds in China from 2005 to 2019 and analyzed the OA formation potential (OAFP) of each volatility bin and source using a two-dimensional volatility basis set (2D-VBS) box model. The emissions of low/extremely low/ultralow VOC (xLVOC) decreased substantially during 2005−2019, while the emissions of SVOC showed significant decline after 2014, mainly because of reduced residential biomass consumption. IVOC and VOC emission amounts in 2019 were similar to those in 2005; however, the major sources of emissions changed substantially. Emissions from volatile chemical products (VCP) increased significantly and became the dominant source of IVOC and VOC emissions. The S/ IVOC from VCP contributed 1322 kt of OAFP in 2019, higher than the total anthropogenic xLVOC emissions. Considering the high of S/IVOC, future air pollution control policies should prioritize VCP, residential biomass burning, and diesel vehicles.},

With strict control measures for air pollutants during the last decade, the OA concentration in China declined slowly, while its sources remain unclear. In this study, we simulate the primary OA (POA) and secondary OA (SOA) concentrations from 2005 to 2019 with a state-of-the-art air quality model, Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ, version 5.3.2) coupled with a Two-Dimensional Volatility Basis Set (2D-VBS) module, and a long-term emission inventory of full-volatility organic compounds in China and conduct source apportionment and sensitivity analysis. The simulation results show that, from 2005 to 2019, the OA concentration in China decreased from 24.0 to 12.8 μg/m3 with most of the reduction from POA. The OA pollution from residential biomass burning declined 75\% from 2005 to 2019, while it is still the major OA source in China. OA pollution from VCP increased by more than 2-fold and became the largest SOA source in China. From 2014 to 2019, the NOx control in China slightly offset the decrease of SOA concentration due to elevated oxidation capacity.},

	abstract = {The serious ﬁne particle (PM2.5) pollution in China causes millions of premature deaths. Driven by swift economic growth and stringent control policies, air pollutant emissions in China have changed signiﬁcantly in the last decade, but the change in the source contribution of PM2.5-related health impacts remains unclear. In this study, we develop a multi-pollutant emission inventory in China for 2005–2015, and combine chemical transport modeling, ambient/household exposure evaluation and health impact assessment to quantify the contribution of eight emission sectors to PM2.5 exposure and associated health risk. From 2005 to 2015, the mortality due to PM2.5 from ambient air pollution (AAP) decreases from 1.04 (95\% conﬁdence interval, 0.84–1.25) million to 0.87 (0.70–1.04) million. The agricultural sector contributes 25\% and 32\% to ambient PM2.5-attributed mortality in 2005 and 2015, respectively, representing the largest contributor during this period. The contribution of power plants drops monotonously from 13\% to 6\%. The percentage contribution of industrial process drops signiﬁcantly while the contribution of industrial combustion stays the same level. The overall contribution of industry is still as large as 26\% in 2015 in spite of strict control measures. For transportation, despite strict emission standards, its contribution increases remarkably due to the rapid growth of vehicle population. When both ambient and household PM2.5 exposures are taken into account, the mortality due to integrated populationweighted exposure to PM2.5 (IPWE) drops from 1.78 (1.46–2.09) million in 2005 to 1.28 (1.05–1.52) million in 2015. Most of the IPWE reduction comes from domestic combustion as a result of urbanization and improved income, whereas this sector remains the largest contributor (58\%) to IPWE-related health risk in 2015. Our results suggest that the government should dynamically adjust the air pollution control strategy according to the change in source contributions. Domestic combustion and agriculture should be prioritized considering their predominant contributions to mortality and the lack of eﬀective control policies. More stringent control measures for industry and transportation are necessary since the existing policies have not adequately reduced their health impacts. Electricity production is no longer the top priority of air pollution control policies given its lower health impact compared with that of other sources.},

This study establishes the first global anthropogenic full-volatility organic emission inventory with chemically speciated or volatility-binned emission factors. The emissions of extremely low/low-volatility organic compounds (xLVOCs), SVOCs, IVOCs, and VOCs in 2015 were 13.2, 10.1, 23.3, and 120.5 Mt, respectively. The full-volatility framework fills a gap of 18.5 Mt I/S/xLVOCs compared with the traditional framework. Volatile chemical products (VCPs), domestic combustion, and onroad transportation sources were dominant contributors to full-volatility emissions, accounting for 30, 30, and 12\%, respectively. The VCP and on-road transportation sectors were the main contributors to IVOCs and VOCs. The key emitting regions included Africa, India, Southeast Asia, China, Europe, and the United States, among which China, Europe, and the United States emitted higher proportions of IVOCs and VOCs owing to the use of cleaner fuel in domestic combustion and more intense emissions from VCPs and on-road transportation activities. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the impact of organic emissions on global air pollution and climate change.},

Here, we proposed health-oriented control strategies by integrating the unequal toxic potencies of the most polluting industrial PMs. Iron and steel industry (ISI)-emitted PM2.5 exhibit about one order of magnitude higher toxic potency than those of cement and power industries. Compared with the current mass-based control strategy (prioritizing implementation of ultralow emission standards in the power sector), the proposed health-oriented control strategy (priority control of the ISI sector) could generate 5.4 times higher reduction in population-weighted toxic potency-adjusted PM2.5 exposure among polluting industries in China. Furthermore, the marginal abatement cost per unit of toxic potency-adjusted mass of ISI-emitted PM2.5 is only a quarter of that of the other two sectors under ultralow emission scenarios. We highlight that a health-oriented air pollution control strategy is urgently required to achieve cost-effective reductions in particulate exposure risks.},

	abstract = {Biogenic secondary organic aerosol (BSOA) produced from naturally emitted biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs) is closely affected by anthropogenic emissions. Reactive nitrogen oxides (NOx), sulfate (SO4), and primary organic aerosol (POA) modulate transformations of BVOCs by altering the oxidation pathways and gas–particle partitioning processes. China has experienced rapid changes in anthropogenic emissions recently, but the response of BSOA remains unclear. We conducted GEOS-Chem simulations to examine this response and found that isoprene-derived SOA increased (3.1\%/yr) similarly as SO4 (3.6\%/yr) over 2000–2006 but declined faster (−8.0\%/yr) than SO4 (−4.3\%/yr) over 2007–2015. Sensitivity simulations suggested that SO4 significantly promoted heterogeneous reactive uptake of isoprene epoxydiols (IEPOX) formed SOA (SOAIE), and a high level of NOx suppressed the production of IEPOX and subsequently reduced SOAIE. The model roughly reproduced observed declines of secondary organic carbon (SOC) and SO4 at a rural site in South China over 2007–2011, although the mass concentrations were substantially underestimated. We find that BSOA would contribute slightly more to PM2.5 (2.8\%) in 2050 under the RCP4.5 scenario than the present day (2.1\%). This model-based work provides insights into historical and future changes of BSOA and implies the need to consider the controllable part for air quality management.},

	abstract = {As the world's most populous country, China has witnessed rapid urbanization in recent decades, with population migration from rural to urban (RU) regions as the major driving force. Due to the large gap between rural and urban consumption and investment level, large-scale RU migration impacts air pollutant emissions and creates extra uncertainties for air quality improvement. Here, we integrated population migration assessment, an environmentally extended input–output model and structural decomposition analysis to evaluate the NOx, SO2 and primary PM2.5 emissions induced by RU migration during China's urbanization from 2005 to 2015. The results show that RU migration increased air pollutant emissions, while the increases in NOx and SO2 emissions peaked in approximately 2010 at 2.4 Mt and 2.2 Mt, accounting for 9.2\% and 8.7\% of the national emissions, respectively. The primary PM2.5 emissions induced by RU migration also peaked in approximately 2012 at 0.3 Mt, accounting for 2.8\% of the national emissions. The indirect emissions embodied in consumption and investment increased, while household direct emissions decreased. The widening gap between urban and rural investment and consumption exerted a major increasing effect on migration-induced emissions; in contrast, the falling emission intensity contributed the most to the decreasing effect benefitting from end-of-pipe control technology applications as well as improving energy efficiency. The peak of air pollutant emissions induced by RU migration indicates that although urbanization currently creates extra environmental pressure in China, it is possible to reconcile urbanization and air quality improvement in the future with updating urbanization and air pollution control policies.},

	abstract = {Ammonia (NH3) abatement remains controversial in China owing to its effectiveness in reducing PM2.5 pollution and nitrogen deposition but with the potential risk of promoting acid rain formation, necessitating scientific guidance. Here, we propose a novel method for designing an NH3 control strategy to mitigate both air pollution and nitrogen deposition without significantly exacerbating acid rain. This method involves extending the response surface model (RSM) to deposition using a delicately developed polynomial response function of deposition (i.e., dep-RSM). The Yangtze River Delta (YRD) dep-RSM application reveals that 16 out of 41 cities have NH3 control potentials from 15 \% to 71 \%. Excellent NH3 control potentials have been noted between April and June (78 \%–92 \%). From 2013 to 2017, the effective SO2 and NOx control significantly reduced wet sulfur and oxidized nitrogen deposition, providing considerable NH3 abatement potentials (15 \%–24 \%) to further reduce PM2.5 and nitrogen deposition by up to 2 \% and 9 \%, respectively, without acid rain exacerbation (the wet neutralization factor was maintained). Additionally, 57 \% and 73 \% NH3 emission reduction potentials were obtained under acid rain constraints with 75 \% and 86 \% reductions in the other precursors to reduce the average PM2.5 concentration below 25 and 15 μg/m3, and an additional 8408 and 14,459 premature deaths could only be avoided at an extra cost of 8.7 and 19.7 billion CNY, respectively. Meanwhile, the N deposition considerably reduced by 10 and 13 kgN/ha·yr. However, the YRD region could still simultaneously obtain substantial amounts of PM2.5 and N deposition mitigation using the strategy proposed herein. The expanded optimization system can be directly adopted by policymakers to implement coordinated control in regions or countries facing the same NH3 control conundrum.},

We present a new top-down method, an improved superposition column model to estimate day-to-day NOx and CO2 emissions from the large city of Wuhan, China, located in a polluted background. The latest released version 2.3.1 TROPOMI (TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument) NO2 columns and version 10r of the Orbiting Carbon Observatory-2 (OCO-2)-observed CO2 mixing ratio are employed. We quantified daily NOx and CO2 emissions from Wuhan between September 2019 and October 2020 with an uncertainty of 31 \% and 43 \%, compared to 39 \% and 49 \% with the earlier v1.3 TROPOMI data, respectively. Our estimated NOx and CO2 emissions are verified against bottom-up inventories with minor deviations (\&lt;3 \% for the 2019 mean, ranging from −20 \% to 48 \% on a daily basis). Based on the estimated CO2 emissions, we also predicted daily CO2 column mixing ratio enhancements, which match well with OCO-2 observations (\&lt;5 \% bias, within ±0.3 ppm). We capture the day-to-day variation of NOx and CO2 emissions from Wuhan in 2019–2020, which does not reveal a substantial “weekend reduction” but does show a clear “holiday reduction” in the NOx and CO2 emissions. Our method also quantifies the abrupt decrease and slow NOx and CO2 emissions rebound due to the Wuhan lockdown in early 2020. This work demonstrates the improved superposition model to be a promising new tool for the quantification of city NOx and CO2 emissions, allowing policymakers to gain real-time information on spatial–temporal emission patterns and the effectiveness of carbon and nitrogen regulation in urban environments.},

We developed high-resolution vehicular NH3 emission inventories for Beijing and Shanghai based on detailed link-level traffic profiles and conducted atmospheric simulations of ambient PM2.5 concentrations contributed by vehicular NH3 emissions. We found that vehicular NH3 emissions shared high proportions among total anthropogenic NH3 emissions in the urban areas of Beijing (86\%) and Shanghai (45\%), where vehicular NH3 was primarily emitted by gasoline vehicles. Local vehicular NH3 emissions could be responsible for approximately 3\% of urban PM2.5 concentrations during wintertime, and the contributions could be much higher during polluted periods (∼3 μg m–3). We also showed that controlling vehicular NH3 emissions will be effective and feasible to alleviate urban PM2.5 pollution for megacities in the near future.},

Our study found weekly NH4+ and NH3 concentrations were on average 2.5 ± 1.4 μg m−3 and 3.8 ± 1.7 μg m−3, respectively during December 2018. Weekly concentration weighted δ15N(NH4+) values ranged from 4.5‰ to 13.7‰ with an average value of 8.2 ± 3.9‰ during December 2018. After accounting for nitrogen isotopic fractionation from NH3 gas to NH4+ conversion, initial δ15N(NH3) values ranged from −22.5‰ to −12.8‰ with an average value of −17.4 ± 3.5‰. Further, weekly measured δ15N(NH3) values ranged from −22.2‰ to −10.2‰ (after correction) with an average value of −15.6 ± 5.3‰ during December 2018. Results from two different isotope-based method showed non-agricultural sources contributed 31.2\%–63.1\%, with an average value of 47.5 ± 14.6\%, to NH4+ and 32.3\%–71.2\%, with an average of 53.4 ± 16.1\%, to ambient NH3 during December 2018 in Beijing. Results from CMAQ-ISAM suggest non-agricultural sources contributed on average 66.2 ± 1.9\% to ambient NH4+ and 66.4 ± 1.9\% to ambient NH3 during December 2018. Results from this study suggest that agricultural and non-agricultural sources nearly equally contributed to NH3 and NH4+ in urban Beijing during December 2018 with an uncertainty range of 13\%–19\% between isotope-based methods and CTM method.},

Here, we established a nationwide, facility-level emission data set considering over 185,000 active boilers in China by fusing multiple data sources and jointly using various technical means. The emission uncertainties and spatial allocations were significantly improved. We found that coal-fired power plant boilers were not the most emission-intensive boilers with regard to SO2, NOx, PM, and mercury but emitted the highest CO2. However, biomass- and municipal waste-fired combustion, regarded as zero-carbon technologies, emitted a large fraction of SO2, NOx, and PM. Future biomass or municipal waste mixing in coal-fired power plant boilers can make full use of the advantages of zero-carbon fuel and the pollution control devices of coal-fired power plants. We identified small-size boilers, medium-size boilers using circulating fluidized bed boilers, and large-size boilers located in China’s coal mine bases as the main high emitters. Future focuses on high-emitter control can substantially mitigate the emissions of SO2 by 66\%, NOx by 49\%, PM by 90\%, mercury by 51\%, and CO2 by 46\% at the most. Our study sheds light on other countries wishing to reduce their energy-related emissions and thus the related impacts on humans, ecosystems, and climates.},

Previous studies on air pollution control have focused on emission reduction demand in China but ignored the influence of transboundary pollution, which has been proven to have a significant impact on air quality in China. Here, we develop an emission–concentration response surface model coupled with transboundary pollution to quantify the emission reduction demand for China to achieve WHO AQG. China cannot achieve WHO AQG by its own emission reduction for high transboundary pollution of both PM2.5 and O3. Reducing transboundary pollution will loosen the reduction demand for NH3 and VOCs emissions in China. However, to meet 10 μg·m–3 for PM2.5 and 60 μg·m–3 for peak season O3, China still needs to reduce its emissions of SO2, NOx, NH3, VOCs, and primary PM2.5 by more than 95, 95, 76, 62, and 96\% respectively, on the basis of 2015. We highlight that both extreme emission reduction in China and great efforts in addressing transboundary air pollution are crucial to reach WHO AQG.},

	abstract = {The ambient air quality standard (AAQS) is a vital policy instrument for protecting the environment and human health. Hainan Province is at the forefront of China's efforts to protect its ecological environment, with an official goal to achieve world-leading air quality by 2035. However, neither the national AAQS nor the WHO guideline offers sufficient guidance for improving air quality in Hainan because Hainan has well met the former while the latter is excessively stringent. Consequently, the establishment of Hainan's local AAQS becomes imperative. Nonetheless, research regarding the development of local AAQS is scarce, especially in comparatively more polluted countries such as China. The relatively high background values and significant interannual fluctuations in air pollutant concentrations in Hainan present challenges in the development of local AAQS. Our research proposes a world-class local AAQS of Hainan Province by reviewing the AAQS in major countries or regions worldwide, analyzing the influence of different statistical forms, and carefully evaluating the attainability of the standard. In the proposed AAQS, the annual mean concentration limit for PM2.5, the annual 95th percentile of daily maximum 8-hour mean (MDA8) concentration limit for O3, and the peak season concentration limit for O3 are set at 10, 120, and 85 μg/m3, respectively. Our study indicates that, with effective control policies, Hainan is projected to achieve compliance with the new standard by 2035. The implementation of the local AAQS is estimated to avoid 1,526 (1,253-1,789) and 259 (132-501) premature deaths attributable to long-term exposure to PM2.5 and O3 in Hainan in 2035, respectively.},

	abstract = {NH3 emission control has proven to be of great importance in reducing PM2.5 concentrations in China, while how it affects nitrogen/sulfur (N/S) deposition is still unclear. This study expanded the response surface model method to quantify the responses of N/S deposition to the emission control of precursors (NOx, SO2, NH3, VOCs and primary PM2.5) in the Yangtze River Delta, China. NH3 control was found to have higher efficiency in reducing N/S deposition than NOx and SO2 alone. The reduced N deposition response to NH3 emission control was higher in the northern part of the YRD region, whereas oxidized N deposition decreased sharply in the region with a low N critical load. Synergetic effect was found in reducing N deposition when we controlled the NH3 and NOx emissions simultaneously. Compared with the sum effect of individual NH3 and NOx emission control, the extra benefits from the synergy controls accounted for 4.4\% (1.23 kg N⋅ha− 1⋅yr− 1) of the total N deposition, of which 81\% came from the oxidized N deposition. The YRD region could receive the largest synergetic effect with a 1:1 ratio of NOx:NH3 emission reduction. The NH3 emission control increases the dry deposition of acid sub­ stances and worsens acid rain though it reduces the wet S/oxidized N deposition. These findings highlight the effectiveness of NH3 emission control and suggest a multi-pollutant control strategy for reducing N/S deposition. The response surface model method for deposition also provides a reference for other regions in China and other countries.},

Here we explore the chemical characteristics, variations, and emission sources of organic aerosol (OA) based on the observation of air pollutants and combination of aerosol mass spectrometer (AMS) and positive matrix factorization (PMF) analysis in Beijing in early 2020. By eliminating the impacts of atmospheric boundary layer and the Spring Festival, we found that the lockdown effectively reduced cooking-related OA (COA) but influenced fossil fuel combustion OA (FFOA) very little. In contrast, both secondary OA (SOA) and O3 formation was enhanced significantly after lockdown: less-oxidized oxygenated OA (LO-OOA, 37\% in OA) was probably an aged product from fossil fuel and biomass burning emission with aqueous chemistry being an important formation pathway, while more-oxidized oxygenated OA (MO-OOA, 41\% in OA) was affected by regional transport of air pollutants and related with both aqueous and photochemical processes. Combining FFOA and LO-OOA, more than 50\% of OA pollution was attributed to combustion activities during the whole observation period. Our findings highlight that fossil fuel/biomass combustion are still the largest sources of OA pollution, and only controlling traffic and cooking emissions cannot efficiently eliminate the heavy air pollution in winter Beijing.},

	abstract = {Heavy metals are concerned for its adverse effect on human health and long term burden on biogeochemical cycling in the ecosystem. In this study, a provincial-level emission inventory of 13 kinds of heavy metals including V, Cr, Mn, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, As, Cd, Sn, Sb, Ba and Pb from 10 anthropogenic sources was developed for China, based on the 2015 national emission inventory of primary particulate matters and source category-specific speciation profiles collected from 50 previous studies measured in China. Uncertainties associated with the speciation profiles were also evaluated. Our results suggested that total emissions of the 13 types of heavy metals in China are estimated at about 58000 ton for the year 2015. The iron production is the dominant source of heavy metal, contributing 42\% of total emissions of heavy metals. The emissions of heavy metals vary significantly at regional scale, with largest amount of emissions concentrated in northern and eastern China. Particular, high emissions of Cr, Co, Ni, As and Sb (contributing 8\%–18\% of the national emissions) are found in Shandong where has large capacity of industrial production. Uncertainty analysis suggested that the implementation of province-specific source profiles in this study significantly reduced the emission uncertainties from (−89\%, 289\%) to (−99\%, 91\%), particularly for coal combustion. However, source profiles for industry sectors such as non-metallic mineral manufacturing are quite limited, resulting in a relative high uncertainty. The high-resolution emission inventories of heavy metals are essential not only for their distribution, deposition and transport studies, but for the design of policies to redress critical atmospheric environmental hazards at local and regional scales. Detailed investigation on source-specific profile in China are still needed to achieve more accurate estimations of heavy metals in the future.},

	abstract = {We investigate responses of sulfate (SO42−) and nitrate (NO3−) to anthropogenic emission changes in 2006–2017 by fixing meteorology at the 2009 level using nested 3D chemical transport model GEOS-Chem. We find that sulfate concentration decreases following SO2 emissions, but with a relatively smaller reduction rate (by 16 \% in North China Plain (NCP) and 28 \% in Yangtze River Delta (YRD)) due to larger sulfur oxidation ratio (SOR) at lower SO2 level. SOR follows a power law with SO2 emissions in general except in winter in NCP, when and where both SO2 emission reduction and atmospheric oxidation capacity are critical to the inter-annual variations of SOR. Nitrate concentration ([pNO3−]) decreases along with NOx emission reduction in summer, but increases slightly in winter in 2011–2017. Equilibrium with gas phase HNO3, NO3− in particle phase (pNO3−) is determined by total HNO3 (TN = [pNO3−] + [gHNO3]) oxidized from NO2 and gas-particle partitioning (ε(NO3−) = [pNO3−]/TN). TN is decreasing faster in summer ({\textasciitilde}33 \%) than in winter ({\textasciitilde}25 \%) in 2011–2017. In contrast, ε(NO3−) changes marginally in summer (within 5 \%) but increases by 36 \% in NCP and by 51 \% in YRD in winter in 2006–2017. The increasing of ε(NO3−) in winter is attributed to the strong reduction of [pSO42−], which increases the relative abundance of NH3 and thus favors partitioning of NO3− to the particle phase. The effect of increasing ε(NO3−) overcomes that of decreasing TN in winter. We suggest reduce SO2 emissions to further reduce [pSO42−] in eastern China. In addition, we recommend reduce NOx emissions in summer, and reduce atmospheric oxidation capacity and relative abundance of NH3 in winter to reduce [pNO3−].},

Changes of summertime ozone and free radical concentrations due to the additional heterogeneous reactions in north China were quantified. These heterogeneous reactions increased the O3, OH, HO2 and RO2 concentrations by up to 20\%, 28\%, 36\% and 48\% for some regions in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei (BTH) area. These areas typically have a larger amount of NOx emissions and a lower VOC/NOx ratio. The zero-out method evaluates that the photolysis of ClNO2 and Cl2 are the major contributors (42.4\% and 57.6\%, respectively) to atmospheric Cl in the early morning hours but the photolysis of Cl2 is the only significant contributor after 10:00 am. The results highlight that heterogeneous reactions of reactive chlorine species are important to atmospheric ozone and free-radical formation. Our study also suggests that the on-going NOx emission controls in the NCP region with a goal to reduce both O3 and secondary nitrate can also have the co-benefit of reducing the formation Cl from ClNO2 and Cl2, which may also lead to lower secondary organic aerosol formation and thus the control of summertime PM2.5 in the region.},

Because of the sparse field measurements, the global significance of HMS and its spatial and seasonal patterns remain unclear. Here, we modify and add to the implementation of HMS chemistry in the GEOS-Chem chemical transport model and conduct multiple global simulations. The model accounts for cloud entrainment and gas–aqueous mass transfer within the rate expressions for heterogeneous sulfur chemistry. Our simulations can generally reproduce quantitative HMS observations from Beijing and show that East Asia has the highest HMS concentration, followed by Europe and North America. The simulated HMS shows a seasonal pattern with higher values in the colder period. Photochemical oxidizing capacity affects the competition of formaldehyde with oxidants (such as ozone and hydrogen peroxide) for sulfur dioxide and is a key factor influencing the seasonality of HMS. The highest average HMS concentration (1–3 µg m−3) and HMS ∕ sulfate molar ratio (0.1–0.2) are found in northern China in winter. The simulations suggest that aqueous clouds act as the major medium for HMS chemistry while aerosol liquid water may play a role if its rate constant for HMS formation is greatly enhanced compared to cloud water.},

            On-road vehicles have become a significant source of air pollution in Chinese cities. Air pollution in China has substantial impacts on public health and is thought to be responsible for millions of deaths each year. The government has implemented comprehensive control measures to mitigate vehicle emissions since the late 1990s. In this paper, we analyze how the historical control actions during 1998–2015 affected air quality and public health. We constructed an integrated framework combining emission scenarios, air quality modeling, and population health risk assessment. Our results demonstrate that the control measures have led to substantial improvements in public health and provide insight into strategies for further mitigation of negative effects from China’s future motorization on air quality and public health.

	abstract = {This study jointly conducted a field investigation and thermodynamic model simulation in three nonferrous metal smelters (NFMS) to identify sulfur oxides (SOX) formation, transformation, and emissions in the flue gas. Most of SOX was released as sulfur dioxides (SO2) at the outlet of the furnace with the molar proportion of sulfur trioxides (SO3) of 1.0–4.1\%. The formation of SO3 in smelters depended on temperature, material composition, and flue gas components. These factors were relatively certain once the production was designed. During the use of air pollution control devices (APCDs), SO3 removal alternated with its formation in the APCDs of the smelting/roasting step. Deep clean measures could not ensure standard emissions of SO3 in all smelters. Under the strict production and emission requirements, we recommended the combined effort of production design, parameter optimization, and deep clean measures to control SO3 pollution. In addition, recognizing the underestimation of the national inventory (10\% at the most) due to the lack of emissions from NFMS, we suggested the attention on SOX emissions from sectors using high-sulfur raw materials in the pyroprocess. Besides, the higher potential of SO3 on secondary particle formation highlighted the distinction of SO3 and SO2 emissions in inventories for better evaluation of their environmental impact.},

	abstract = {China is challenged with the simultaneous goals of improving air quality and mitigating climate change. The “Beautiful China” strategy, launched by the Chinese government in 2020, requires that all cities in China attain 35 μg/m3 or below for annual mean concentration of PM2.5 (particulate matter with aerodynamic diameter less than 2.5 μm) by 2035. Meanwhile, China adopts a portfolio of low-carbon policies to meet its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) pledged in the Paris Agreement. Previous studies demonstrated the cobenefits to air pollution reduction from implementing low-carbon energy policies. Pathways for China to achieve dual targets of both air quality and CO2 mitigation, however, have not been comprehensively explored. Here, we couple an integrated assessment model and an air quality model to evaluate air quality in China through 2035 under the NDC scenario and an alternative scenario (Co-Benefit Energy [CBE]) with enhanced low-carbon policies. Results indicate that some Chinese cities cannot meet the PM2.5 target under the NDC scenario by 2035, even with the strictest end-of-pipe controls. Achieving the air quality target would require further reduction in emissions of multiple air pollutants by 6 to 32\%, driving additional 22\% reduction in CO2 emissions relative to the NDC scenario. Results show that the incremental health benefit from improved air quality of CBE exceeds 8 times the additional costs of CO2 mitigation, attributed particularly to the cost-effective reduction in household PM2.5 exposure. The additional low-carbon energy polices required for China’s air quality targets would lay an important foundation for its deep decarbonization aligned with the 2 °C global temperature target.},

By requiring only two CTM simulations for model application, the new method significantly enhances the computational efficiency compared to existing methods that achieve lower accuracy despite requiring 20+ CTM simulations (the benchmark statistical model). Our results demonstrate the utility of deep learning approaches for capturing the nonlinearity of atmospheric chemistry and physics and the prospects of the new method to support effective policymaking in other environment systems.},

	abstract = {Aerosol direct effects (ADEs) can modulate shortwave radiation as well as atmospheric dynamics and air quality. As the key absorbing component of aerosol, the black carbon (BC) largely determines the aerosol optical properties. Therefore, it is expected that BC emission controls might gain co-benefits from the simultaneous reduction of ADEs. To demonstrate such synergy, here we quantified the ADEs changes and the role of BC controls in China during 2013–2017 using a regional two-way coupled meteorology chemistry transport model. Simulated results suggest that the control action effectively reduced the wintertime PM2.5 concentration (−26.0 μg m−3) and associated ADEs. In January, the influence of ADEs on surface shortwave radiation, 2-meter temperature, and planetary boundary layer height was weakened from −16.7 W m−2, −0.20 °C, and −15.4 m in 2013 to −11.3 W m−2, −0.06 °C, and −10.7 m in 2017, respectively. The enhancement of SO2, NO2, and PM2.5 concentrations due to ADEs was reduced from +3.1\%, +5.2\%, and +5.4\% in 2013 to +2.6\%, +4.5\%, and +3.3\% in 2017, respectively, demonstrating the extra benefit of air pollution controls for improving air quality by reducing ADEs. Meanwhile, the BC emission reduced by 12.5\% simultaneously along with the effective controls on SO2 and NO2 emissions during 2013–2017, mainly from domestic combustion (−11.7\%), resulting in 30.3\% (−0.9 μg m−3) reduction of BC concentration. Such BC controls contributed 15.6–60.2\% of such changes in the ADEs influence on meteorological variables, and 32.6–41.1\% on air pollutants. More specially, the effectiveness of collaborative reduction of BC further reduced surface shortwave radiation in China by 3.6 W m−2 in January and 1.0 W m−2 in July, leading to a more weakened ADEs that bring extra benefits in reducing PM2.5 concentrations by 1.8 μg m−3 in January and 0.3 μg m−3 in July. Apparently, BC played an important role in modulating the ADEs and associated influences on meteorology and air quality, suggesting a wise control strategy by targeting absorbing component of PM2.5 reduction to address both air pollution and climate change in the future.},

The model with the existing HONO chemistry in CMAQ severely underestimates the observed HONO concentrations with a normalized mean bias of −97 \%. We revise the HONO chemistry in the model by implementing six additional heterogeneous reactions in the model: the reaction of nitrogen dioxide (NO2) on ground surfaces, the reaction of NO2 on aerosol surfaces, the reaction of NO2 on soot surfaces, the photolysis of aerosol nitrate, the nitric acid displacement reaction, and the hydrochloric acid displacement reaction. The model with the revised chemistry substantially increases HONO predictions and improves the comparison with observed data with a normalized mean bias of −5 \%. The photolysis of HONO enhances daytime hydroxyl radical by almost a factor of 2. The enhanced hydroxyl radical concentrations compare favorably with observed data and produce additional sulfate via the reaction with sulfur dioxide, aerosol nitrate via the reaction with nitrogen dioxide, and secondary organic aerosols via the reactions with volatile organic compounds. The additional sulfate stemming from revised HONO chemistry improves the comparison with observed concentration; however, it does not close the gap between model prediction and the observation during polluted days.},

	abstract = {Quantifying the full-volatility organic emissions from cooking sources is important for understanding the causes of organic aerosol pollution. However, existing national cooking emission inventories in China fail to cover full-volatility organics and have large biases in estimating emissions and their spatial distribution. Here, we develop the first emission inventory of full-volatility organics from cooking in China, which covers emissions from individual commercial restaurants as well as residential kitchens and canteens. In our emission estimates, we use cuisine-specific full-volatility emission factors and provincial policy-driven purification facility installation proportions, which allows us to consider the significant impact of diverse dietary preferences and policy changes on China's cooking emissions. The 2021 emissions of volatile organic compounds (VOCs), intermediate-volatility organic compounds (IVOCs), semi-volatile organic compounds (SVOCs), and organic compounds with even lower volatility (xLVOCs) from cooking in China are 561 (317–891, 95 \% confidence interval) kt yr−1, 241 (135–374) kt yr−1, 176 (95.8–290) kt yr−1, and 13.1 (7.36–21.0) kt yr−1, respectively. The IVOC and SVOC emissions from cooking account for 9 \%–21 \% and 31 \%–62 \% of the total emissions from all sources in the five most densely populated cities in China. Among all cooking types, commercial cooking dominates the emissions, contributing 54.5 \%, 66.2 \%, 68.5 \%, and 46.7 \% to the VOC, IVOC, SVOC, and xLVOC emissions, respectively. Sichuan–Hunan cuisine contributes the most to total cooking emissions among all commercial cuisines. Residential cooking emissions are also important, accounting for 22.2 \%–47.1 \% of the cooking organic emissions across the four volatility ranges, whereas canteens make minor contributions to each volatility range (\&lt;10 \%). In terms of spatial distribution, emission hotspots mainly occur in densely populated areas and regions with oily and spicy dietary preferences. From 2015 to 2021, national organic emissions from cooking increased by 25.2 \% because of the rapid growth of the catering industry, despite being partly offset by the increased installation of purification facilities. Future control measures need to further promote the purification facilities in commercial restaurants and improve their removal efficiency as well as reduce emissions from residential cooking. Our dataset and generalizable methodology serve as valuable resources for evaluating the air quality, climate, and health impacts of cooking sources, and help to formulate effective emission control policies.

	abstract = {A synergistic pathway is regarded as a critical measure for tackling the intertwined challenges of climate change and air pollution in China. However, there is as yet no indicator that can comprehensively reflect such synergistic effects; hence, existing studies lack a consistent framework for comparison. Here, we introduce a new synergistic indicator defined as the pollutant generation per gross domestic product (GDP) and adopt an integrated analysis framework by linking the logarithmic mean Divisia index (LMDI) method, response surface model (RSM), and global exposure mortality model (GEMM) to evaluate the synergistic effects of carbon mitigation on both air pollutant reduction and public health in China. The results show that synergistic effects played an increasingly important role in the emissions mitigation of SO2, NOx, and primary particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter no greater than 2.5 μm (PM2.5), and the synergistic mitigation of pollutants respectively increase from 3.1, 1.4, and 0.3 Mt during the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP) (2006–2010) to 5.6, 3.7, and 1.9 Mt during the 12th FYP (2011–2015). Against the non-control scenario, synergistic effects alone contributed to a 15\% reduction in annual mean PM2.5 concentration, resulting in the prevention of 0.29 million (95\% confidential interval: 0.28–0.30) PM2.5-attributable excess deaths in 2015. Synergistic benefits to air quality improvement and public health were remarkable in the developed and population-dense eastern provinces and municipalities. With the processes of urbanization and carbon neutrality in the future, synergistic effects are expected to continue to increase. Realizing climate targets in advance in developed regions would concurrently bring strong synergistic effects to air quality and public health.},

	abstract = {From 2013 to 2019, a series of air pollution control actions significantly reduced PM2.5 pollution in China. Control actions included changes in activity levels, structural adjustment (SA) policy, energy and material saving (EMS) policy, and end-of-pipe (EOP) control in several sources, which have not been systematically studied in previous studies. Here, we integrate an emission inventory, a chemical transport model, a health impact assessment model, and a scenario analysis to quantify the contribution of each control action across a range of major emission sources to the changes in PM2.5 concentrations and associated mortality in China from 2013 to 2019. Assuming equal toxicity of PM2.5 from all the sources, we estimate that PM2.5-related mortality decreased from 2.52 (95 \% confidence interval, 2.13–2.88) to 1.94 (1.62–2.24) million deaths. Anthropogenic emission reductions and declining baseline incidence rates significantly contributed to health benefits, but population aging partially offset their impact. Among the major sources, controls on power plants and industrial boilers were responsible for the highest reduction in PM2.5-related mortality ({\textasciitilde}80 \%), followed by industrial processes ({\textasciitilde}40 \%), residential combustion ({\textasciitilde}40 \%), and transportation ({\textasciitilde}30 \%). However, considering the potentially higher relative risks of power plant PM2.5, the adverse effects avoided by their control could be {\textasciitilde}2.4 times the current estimation. Our power plant sensitivity analyses indicate that future estimates of source-specific PM2.5 health effects should incorporate variations in individual source PM2.5 effect coefficients when available. As for the control actions, while activity levels increased for most sources, SA policy significantly reduced the emissions in residential combustion and industrial boilers, and EOP control dominated the contribution in health benefits in most sources except residential combustion. Considering the emission reduction potential by source and control actions in 2019, our results suggest that promoting clean energy in residential combustion and enforcing more stringent EOP control in the iron and steel industry should be prioritized in the future.},

	abstract = {China currently has the highest acid deposition globally, yet research on its status, impacts, causes and controls is lacking. Here, we compiled data and calculated critical loads regarding acid deposition. The results showed that the abatement measures in China have achieved a sharp decline in the emissions of acidifying pollutants and a continuous recovery of precipitation pH, despite the drastic growth in the economy and energy consumption. However, the risk of ecological acidification and eutrophication showed no significant decrease. With similar emission reductions, the decline in areas at risk of acidification in China (7.0\%) lags behind those in Europe (20\%) or the USA (15\%). This was because, unlike Europe and the USA, China’s abatement strategies primarily target air quality improvement rather than mitigating ecological impacts. Given that the area with the risk of eutrophication induced by nitrogen deposition remained at 13\% of the country even under the scenario of achieving the dual targets of air quality and carbon dioxide mitigation in 2035, we explored an enhanced ammonia abatement pathway. With a further 27\% reduction in ammonia by 2035, China could largely eliminate the impacts of acid deposition. This research serves as a valuable reference for China’s future acid deposition control and for other nations facing similar challenges.},

	abstract = {Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) hydrolysis in deliquesced aerosol particles forms nitrous acid and nitrate and thus impacts air quality, climate, and the nitrogen cycle. Traditionally, it is considered to proceed far too slowly in the atmosphere. However, the significance of this process is highly uncertain because kinetic studies have only been made in dilute aqueous solutions but not under high ionic strength conditions of the aerosol particles. Here, we use laboratory experiments, air quality models, and field measurements to examine the effect of the ionic strength on the reaction kinetics of NO2 hydrolysis. We find that high ionic strengths (I) enhance the reaction rate constants (kI) by more than an order of magnitude compared to that at infinite dilution (kI=0), yielding log10(kI/kI=0) = 0.04I or rate enhancement factor = 100.04I. A state-of-the-art air quality model shows that the enhanced NO2 hydrolysis reduces the negative bias in the simulated concentrations of nitrous acid by 28\% on average when compared to field observations over the North China Plain. Rapid NO2 hydrolysis also enhances the levels of nitrous acid in other polluted regions such as North India and further promotes atmospheric oxidation capacity. This study highlights the need to evaluate various reaction kinetics of atmospheric aerosols with high ionic strengths.},

	abstract = {In the pursuit of carbon neutrality, China’s 2060 targets have been largely anchored in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, with less emphasis on the consequential benefits for air quality and public health. This study pivots to this critical nexus, exploring how China’s carbon neutrality aligns with the World Health Organization’s air quality guidelines (WHO AQG) regarding fine particulate matter (PM2.5) exposure. Coupling a technology-rich integrated assessment model, an emission–concentration response surface model, and exposure and health assessment, we find that decarbonization reduces sulfur dioxide (SO2), nitrogen oxides (NOx), and PM2.5 emissions by more than 90\%; reduces nonmethane volatile organic compounds (NMVOCs) by more than 50\%; and simultaneously reduces the disparities  across regions. Critically, our analysis reveals that further targeted reductions in air pollutants, notably NH3 and non-energy-related NMVOCs, could bring most Chinese cities into attainment of WHO AQG for PM2.5 5 to 10 years earlier than the pathway focused solely on carbon neutrality. Thus, the integration of air pollution control measures into carbon neutrality strategies will present a significant opportunity for China to attain health and environmental equality.},

	abstract = {China’s advancements in addressing air pollution and reducing CO2 emissions offer valuable lessons for collaborative strategies to achieve diverse environmental objectives. Previous studies have assessed the mutual benefits of climate policies and air pollution control measures on one another, lacking an integrated assessment of the benefits of synergistic control attributed to refined measures. Here, we comprehensively used coupled emission inventory and response models to evaluate the integrated benefits and synergy degrees of various measures in reducing air pollutants and CO2 in China during 2013–2021. Results indicated that the implemented measures yielded integrated benefits value at 6.7 (2.4–12.6) trillion Chinese Yuan. The top five contributors, accounting for 55\%, included promoting non-thermal power, implementing end-of-pipe control technologies in power plants and iron and steel industry, replacing residential scattered coal, and saving building energy. Measures demonstrating high synergies and integrated benefits per unit of reduction (e.g., green traffic promotion) yielded low benefits mainly due to their low application, which are expected to gain greater implementation and prioritization in the future. Our findings provide insights into the effectiveness and limitations of strategies aimed at joint control. By ranking these measures based on their benefits and synergy, we offer valuable guidance for policy development in China and other nations with similar needs.},

	abstract = {Reducing air pollutants and CO2 emissions from energy utilization is crucial for achieving the dual objectives of clean air and carbon neutrality in China. Thus, an optimized health-oriented strategy is urgently needed. Herein, by coupling a CO2 and air pollutants emission inventory with response surface models for PM2.5-associated mortality, we shed light on the effectiveness of protecting human health and co-CO2 benefit from reducing fuel-related emissions and generate a health-oriented strategy for the Yangtze River Delta (YRD). Results reveal that oil consumption is the primary contributor to fuel-related PM2.5 pollution and premature deaths in the YRD. Significantly, curtailing fuel consumption in transportation is the most effective measure to alleviate the fuel-related PM2.5 health impact, which also has the greatest cobenefits for CO2 emission reduction on a regional scale. Reducing fuel consumption will achieve substantial health improvements especially in eastern YRD, with nonroad vehicle emission reductions being particularly impactful for health protection, while on-road vehicles present the greatest potential for CO2 reductions. Scenario analysis confirms the importance of mitigating oil consumption in the transportation sector in addressing PM2.5 pollution and climate change.},

	abstract = {The increasing level of O3 pollution in China significantly exacerbates the long-term O3 health damage, and an optimized health-oriented strategy for NOx and VOCs emission abatement is needed. Here, we developed an integrated evaluation and optimization system for the O3 control strategy by merging a response surface model for the O3-related mortality and an optimization module. Applying this system to the Yangtze River Delta (YRD), we evaluated driving factors for mortality changes from 2013 to 2017, quantified spatial and temporal O3-related mortality responses to precursor emission abatement, and optimized a health-oriented control strategy. Results indicate that insufficient NOx emission abatement combined with deficient VOCs control from 2013 to 2017 aggravated O3-related mortality, particularly during spring and autumn. Northern YRD should promote VOCs control due to higher VOC-limited characteristics, whereas fastening NOx emission abatement is more favorable in southern YRD. Moreover, promotion of NOx mitigation in late spring and summer and facilitating VOCs control in spring and autumn could further reduce O3-related mortality by nearly 10\% compared to the control strategy without seasonal differences. These findings highlight that a spatially and temporally differentiated NOx and VOCs emission control strategy could gain more O3-related health benefits, offering valuable insights to regions with severe ozone pollution all over the world.},

	abstract = {PM2.5 is still one of the major atmospheric pollutants worldwide. Extracting contributions of anthropogenic emission control from the observed PM2.5 variations (PM2.5\_anth), which are also strongly affected by meteorological changes, is critical for effective pollution control. Statistical and machine learning methods are usually used for such purpose, but the effectiveness of these methods is hard to evaluate due to the lack of observed anthropogenic contributions. In this study, we use the chemical transport model GEOS-Chem standard simulation to mimic PM2.5 variability in the real atmosphere, and use the model simulation with fixed meteorological fields as the “true value” for PM2.5\_anth. We evaluate the effectiveness of three methods in meteorological normalization of PM2.5 on decadal (2006–2017) and synoptic (one month) scale: multiple linear regression (MLR), general additive model (GAM), and random forest (RF) algorithm. For meteorological normalization of PM2.5 on decadal scale, 67–72\% of the MLR simulations show positive biases and 56–75\% of the RF simulations show negative biases. The “true value” of PM2.5\_anth falls within the range of meteorological normalization results of the three methods in most cases, but consistent positive/negative biases are observed in ∼30\% of the cases, when meteorological changes dominate PM2.5 variability. In addition, the biases are correlated to the contribution of meteorological changes. As such, multiple statistical or machine learning methods are recommended to quantify the uncertainties associated with method choice in cases anthropogenic emission changes dominate PM2.5 variability. On synoptic scale, RF performs better in reproducing the daily variations of the PM2.5\_anth differences than MLR (GAM) in all (83\% of) the cases, and is recommended for meteorological normalization of PM2.5 in short-term in eastern China.},
